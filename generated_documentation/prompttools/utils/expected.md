# `expected.py` Module Documentation

## Overview

The `expected.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package and provides functionality to interact with OpenAI's language models, specifically GPT-4, to generate expected responses to prompts and evaluate the similarity of given responses to these expected results. It is designed to be used in projects that require automated testing or evaluation of text generated by language models.

## Functions

### `compute`

```python
def compute(prompt: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> str:
```

#### Description

Generates an expected response to a given prompt using a specified language model from OpenAI, defaulting to GPT-4.

#### Parameters

- `prompt (str)`: The input text prompt for which the expected response is to be generated.
- `model (str)`: The identifier for the OpenAI language model to use. Defaults to "gpt-4".

#### Returns

- `(str)`: The content of the message from the first choice of the model's response.

#### Raises

- `PromptToolsUtilityError`: If the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set.

#### Usage

This function is typically used to obtain a baseline response from a high-quality language model to compare against other responses.

### `evaluate`

```python
def evaluate(prompt: str, response: str, model: str = "gpt-4") -> str:
```

#### Description

Evaluates the similarity between a given response and the expected result generated by the same prompt using a specified language model.

#### Parameters

- `prompt (str)`: The input text prompt.
- `response (str)`: The response text to be evaluated against the expected result.
- `model (str)`: The identifier for the OpenAI language model to use for generating the expected response. Defaults to "gpt-4".

#### Returns

- `(str)`: A similarity score between the given response and the expected response.

#### Usage

This function is used to compute how closely a response matches the expected result from a language model, which can be useful for testing or quality assurance purposes.

### `compute_similarity_against_model`

```python
def compute_similarity_against_model(
    row: pandas.core.series.Series,
    prompt_column_name: str,
    model: str = "gpt-4",
    response_column_name: str = "response",
) -> str:
```

#### Description

Computes the similarity of a response contained within a DataFrame row to the expected result generated by a language model using the corresponding prompt from the same row.

#### Parameters

- `row (pandas.core.series.Series)`: A single row from a pandas DataFrame, which includes the prompt and response data among other possible metrics.
- `prompt_column_name (str)`: The column name in the DataFrame that contains the input prompt.
- `model (str)`: The identifier for the OpenAI language model to use for generating the expected response. Defaults to "gpt-4".
- `response_column_name (str)`: The column name in the DataFrame that contains the response to be evaluated. Defaults to "response".

#### Returns

- `(str)`: A similarity score between the response in the row and the expected response generated by the model.

#### Usage

This function is particularly useful for batch processing of a DataFrame where each row contains a prompt-response pair. It allows for the automated evaluation of responses in the context of a larger dataset.

## Dependencies

- `os`: To access environment variables.
- `openai`: To interact with OpenAI's API for generating responses.
- `pandas.core.series`: To handle individual rows of a DataFrame as Series objects.
- `.error`: To raise custom errors defined within the `prompttools` package.
- `.similarity`: To compute similarity scores between text responses.

## Error Handling

The module includes error handling to ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment before attempting to generate responses with OpenAI's API. If the key is not set, a `PromptToolsUtilityError` is raised.

## Integration

The module is designed to be integrated into larger projects that require automated interaction with language models for tasks such as testing, evaluation, or data analysis. It can be used as a standalone utility or as part of a suite of tools within the `prompttools` package.
