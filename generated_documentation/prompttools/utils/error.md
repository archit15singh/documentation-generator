# `error.py` Module Documentation

## Overview

The `error.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It defines a custom exception class that is used throughout the `prompttools` utility to handle error scenarios specific to the utility's operations.

## Classes

### `PromptToolsUtilityError`

#### Description

`PromptToolsUtilityError` is a custom exception class that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. This custom exception is designed to be raised when an error occurs within the `prompttools` utility that is not adequately described by Python's standard exceptions.

#### Usage

The `PromptToolsUtilityError` class is intended to be used in the following manner:

1. The class is imported into other modules within the `prompttools` utility where error handling is required.
2. When an error condition is encountered that is specific to the `prompttools` utility's functionality, an instance of `PromptToolsUtilityError` is raised with an appropriate error message.
3. The raised `PromptToolsUtilityError` can be caught and handled by the calling code, allowing for graceful degradation of the utility or user notification of the issue.

#### Example

```python
from prompttools.utils.error import PromptToolsUtilityError

def some_function():
    try:
        # Code that may cause a specific error related to prompttools
        ...
    except SomeSpecificError as e:
        # Handle specific error and raise custom exception
        raise PromptToolsUtilityError("An error occurred in prompttools: " + str(e))
```

In this example, `some_function` is a hypothetical function within the `prompttools` utility. If a specific error occurs, it is caught, and a `PromptToolsUtilityError` is raised with additional context about the error.
