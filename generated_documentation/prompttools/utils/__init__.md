# `prompttools.utils` Module

## Overview

The `prompttools.utils` module is a collection of utility functions and submodules designed to support various operations such as automatic evaluation, validation, moderation, and similarity computation within the `documentation-generator` project. This module is part of the `prompttools` package, which is likely used for generating or processing documentation based on prompts.

## Submodules and Functions

### Submodules

- `autoeval`: Contains functions for automatic evaluation of responses.
- `expected`: Provides functionality to handle expected responses.
- `validate_json`: Includes functions to validate JSON responses.
- `validate_python`: Contains functions to validate Python code responses.
- `similarity`: Offers methods to compute semantic similarity.

### Functions

- `autoeval_binary_scoring`: A function that performs binary scoring for automatic evaluation.
- `autoeval_from_expected_response`: A function that automatically evaluates a response based on an expected response.
- `autoeval_scoring`: A function that calculates a score for automatic evaluation.
- `autoeval_with_documents`: A function that performs automatic evaluation in the context of documents.
- `chunk_text`: A utility function that breaks down text into manageable chunks.
- `compute_similarity_against_model`: A function that computes similarity against a model's output.
- `apply_moderation`: A function that applies moderation rules to content.
- `ranking_correlation`: A function that calculates the correlation between different rankings.
- `semantic_similarity`: A function that computes the semantic similarity between pieces of text.
- `validate_json_response`: A function that validates a JSON response for correctness.
- `validate_python_response`: A function that validates a Python code response for correctness.

## Usage

The functions and submodules within `prompttools.utils` are likely used throughout the `documentation-generator` project to perform tasks such as:

- Automatically scoring generated documentation against a set of criteria or expected outputs.
- Validating the structure and content of JSON and Python responses to ensure they meet project requirements.
- Moderating content to filter out inappropriate or unwanted material.
- Computing the similarity between different pieces of text, which can be useful for tasks like detecting plagiarism or ensuring content uniqueness.
- Chunking large texts into smaller parts for easier processing or analysis.

## Importing

The module exposes its submodules and functions through the `__init__.py` file, allowing for convenient importing within the project. For example, to use the `semantic_similarity` function, one would import it as follows:

```python
from prompttools.utils import semantic_similarity
```

## `__all__` Variable

The `__all__` variable is defined to explicitly declare the exported names from the module. This list includes all the submodules and functions that are intended to be used when importing `prompttools.utils` using the `from prompttools.utils import *` syntax. This ensures that only the specified names are imported and prevents any unintended names from being exposed.

## Licensing

The module includes a header comment indicating that the source code is copyrighted by Hegel AI, Inc. and that the license for the source code can be found in the LICENSE file located in the root directory of the source tree. This suggests that the module is proprietary and its use is subject to the terms of the license.

## Conclusion

The `prompttools.utils` module is a central part of the `documentation-generator` project, providing essential tools for automatic evaluation, validation, moderation, and similarity computation. Its well-defined interface allows for easy integration within the project, facilitating the generation and processing of documentation based on prompts.
