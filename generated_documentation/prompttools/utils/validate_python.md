# `validate_python.py` Module

## Overview

The `validate_python.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package and provides functionality to validate whether a given text string is syntactically correct Python code. It is designed to be used within a larger project that generates or manipulates Python code, ensuring that the output is valid Python before it is executed or further processed.

## Dependencies

- `os`: Standard Python module to interact with the operating system.
- `typing.Dict`: Type hinting for dictionaries.
- `pandas.core.series`: Used to handle data in a series format, typically obtained from a DataFrame.
- `error.PromptToolsUtilityError`: Custom exception class defined within the `prompttools` package for error handling.
- `pylint.epylint`: External library used for linting Python code. It is an optional dependency and must be installed separately.

## Temporary File

- `PROMPTTOOLS_TMP`: A constant string that defines the name of a temporary file (`"prompttools_tmp.py"`) used during the validation process.

## Functions

### `validate(text: str) -> float`

Validates that the provided text is syntactically correct Python code.

#### Arguments

- `text (str)`: The generated text which is expected to be valid Python code.

#### Behavior

1. Checks if `pylint` is available. If not, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that `pylint` is required.
2. Checks if the temporary file defined by `PROMPTTOOLS_TMP` already exists. If it does, raises a `PromptToolsUtilityError`.
3. Writes the input text to the temporary file.
4. Runs `pylint` on the temporary file and captures the standard output.
5. Deletes the temporary file.
6. Returns `0.0` if the word "error" is found in the `pylint` output, indicating invalid Python code. Otherwise, returns `1.0`, indicating valid Python code.

### `validate_python_response(row: pandas.core.series.Series, response_column_name: str = "response") -> float`

Validates whether the `response` string in a given row follows Python's syntax.

#### Arguments

- `row (pandas.core.series.Series)`: A row of data from a DataFrame, which includes various columns such as input, model response, and other metrics.
- `response_column_name (str)`: The name of the column that contains the model's response. Defaults to `"response"`.

#### Behavior

1. Calls the `validate` function, passing the value from the `response_column_name` of the given row.
2. Returns the result of the `validate` function.

### `evaluate(prompt: str, response: str, metadata: Dict) -> float`

Validates whether the `response` string follows Python's syntax. This function is designed to conform to a common evaluation interface.

#### Arguments

- `prompt (str)`: The input prompt string. Not used in the function.
- `response (str)`: The string that will be validated as Python code.
- `metadata (Dict)`: Additional metadata. Not used in the function.

#### Behavior

1. Calls the `validate` function, passing the `response` string.
2. Returns the result of the `validate` function.

## Usage

This module is used to ensure that text generated by a model or entered by a user is valid Python code. It can be integrated into a larger system that requires validation of Python syntax, such as code generation tools, automated testing frameworks, or educational platforms that evaluate Python exercises.

## Error Handling

- If `pylint` is not installed, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
- If the temporary file already exists, a `PromptToolsUtilityError` is raised to prevent overwriting or data corruption.

## Notes

- The module assumes that `pylint` is installed and is less than version 3.0.
- The temporary file is used to avoid in-memory linting and to work around limitations of `pylint`'s API.
- The module does not handle the case where the temporary file cannot be deleted due to permissions or other file system issues.
- The module does not provide detailed error messages or locations of syntax errors in the code; it only indicates whether an error was detected by `pylint`.
