## `ThresholdType` Enum Class

### Overview

The `ThresholdType` class is an enumeration that defines constant values representing different types of thresholds that can be applied to test cases within the project. This class is part of the `prompttools` package, specifically within the `prompttest` module, and is located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/prompttest/threshold_type.py`.

### Usage

The `ThresholdType` enum is used to specify the kind of threshold that a user wants to apply to a test case. It helps in maintaining a clear and standardized way of referring to threshold types across the project. By using an enum, the code becomes more readable and less prone to errors that might occur due to the use of plain strings or integers.

### Enum Members

The `ThresholdType` enum defines the following members:

- `MINIMUM`: This member has an integer value of `1` and represents a minimum threshold. It is used when the user wants to specify a lower bound for a test case, ensuring that the test value does not fall below this threshold.

- `MAXIMUM`: This member has an integer value of `2` and represents a maximum threshold. It is used when the user wants to specify an upper bound for a test case, ensuring that the test value does not exceed this threshold.

### Importing and Referencing

To use the `ThresholdType` enum in other parts of the project, it must first be imported:

```python
from prompttools.prompttest.threshold_type import ThresholdType
```

Once imported, the enum can be referenced in the code as follows:

```python
def set_threshold(threshold_type: ThresholdType, value: float):
    if threshold_type == ThresholdType.MINIMUM:
        # Implement logic for minimum threshold
        pass
    elif threshold_type == ThresholdType.MAXIMUM:
        # Implement logic for maximum threshold
        pass
```

### Conclusion

The `ThresholdType` enum is a simple yet crucial part of the `prompttools` package, providing a standardized way to handle threshold types in test cases. Its use ensures consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors in threshold-related logic throughout the project.
