# `failure.py` Module

## Overview

The `failure.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package, specifically within the `prompttest.error` subpackage. It is designed to handle failures in prompt testing by providing a custom exception class and a logging function to output failure details to the console.

## Contents

### Import Statements

```python
from prompttools.prompttest.threshold_type import ThresholdType
```

This import statement brings in the `ThresholdType` enumeration from the `threshold_type` module, which is used to distinguish between minimum and maximum threshold types in the context of prompt testing.

### `PromptTestSetupException` Class

```python
class PromptTestSetupException(Exception):
    """
    An exception to throw when something goes wrong with the prompt test setup.
    """
    pass
```

This class is a custom exception type that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. It is intended to be raised when there is an issue with setting up a prompt test, such as invalid configuration or parameters.

### `log_failure` Function

```python
def log_failure(metric_name, threshold, actual, threshold_type):
    """
    Prints the test results to the console.
    """
    # Function implementation...
```

#### Parameters

- `metric_name` (str): The name of the metric that failed the test.
- `threshold` (float/int): The threshold value that the actual result was expected to meet or exceed.
- `actual` (float/int): The actual value obtained from the test.
- `threshold_type` (ThresholdType): An instance of the `ThresholdType` enumeration indicating whether the threshold is a minimum or maximum value.

#### Functionality

The `log_failure` function is responsible for logging the details of a failed test to the console. It constructs a formatted message that includes the metric name, the expected threshold, the actual result, and the type of threshold (minimum or maximum). The message is printed with alignment to enhance readability.

#### Implementation Details

The function prints two messages:

1. The first message includes the following:
   - A header "Test failed: " followed by the `metric_name`.
   - The "Threshold: " label aligned with the header, followed by the `threshold` value.
   - The "Actual: " label aligned with the header, followed by the `actual` value.
   - The "Type: " label aligned with the header, followed by a string representation of the `threshold_type` ("Minimum" or "Maximum").

2. The second message prints a line of dashes ("-") that matches the length of the header plus the metric name, serving as a visual separator.

#### Example Usage

The `log_failure` function would typically be called within a testing framework when an assertion fails due to a metric not meeting the specified threshold. The function outputs the failure details to the console for the developer to review.

## Integration

The `failure.py` module is likely integrated into a larger testing suite within the `prompttools` package. It would be used in conjunction with other modules that perform prompt testing, where it can provide error handling and failure logging capabilities.

## Conclusion

The `failure.py` module is a utility for logging test failures in a structured and readable format to the console, as well as defining a custom exception for prompt test setup issues.
