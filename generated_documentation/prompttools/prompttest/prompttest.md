# Technical Documentation for `prompttest.py`

## Overview

The `prompttest.py` module is part of the `documentation-generator` project and is located within the `prompttools/prompttest` subdirectory. It is designed to facilitate the creation and execution of a suite of prompt tests for evaluating the performance of AI models or functions against predefined prompts and expected outcomes.

## Dependencies

- `typing`: Provides support for type hints.
- `functools.wraps`: Used to preserve the metadata of the original function when it is decorated.
- `logging`: Utilized for logging warnings and other messages.
- `threshold_type`: A module that defines the `ThresholdType` enumeration.
- `error.failure`: Contains the `PromptTestSetupException` class for handling setup exceptions.
- `runner.runner`: Includes the `run_prompttest` function that executes the actual prompt test.

## Global Variables

- `TESTS_TO_RUN`: A list that stores all the test functions to be executed.

## Functions

### `prompttest`

#### Description

The `prompttest` function is a higher-order function that returns a decorator. This decorator can be applied to functions that generate completions for prompts. It is used to define a test by specifying various parameters such as the metric name, evaluation function, prompts, threshold, threshold type, and expected results.

#### Parameters

- `metric_name` (str): The name of the metric used for evaluation.
- `eval_fn` (Callable): The evaluation function that assesses the quality of the completions.
- `prompts` (List[str]): A list of prompt strings to be used for generating completions.
- `threshold` (float, optional): The threshold value for the metric to determine test success. Defaults to 1.0.
- `threshold_type` (ThresholdType, optional): An instance of `ThresholdType` that specifies whether the threshold is a minimum or maximum value. Defaults to `ThresholdType.MINIMUM`.
- `expected` (Optional[List[str]], optional): An optional list of expected completion strings corresponding to the prompts.

#### Returns

- A decorator function that can be used to annotate a completion-generating function.

### `prompttest_decorator`

#### Description

The `prompttest_decorator` is an inner function of `prompttest` that takes a completion function as an argument and wraps it to create a test function. This test function is then appended to the `TESTS_TO_RUN` list.

#### Parameters

- `completion_fn` (Callable): The function that generates completions for the given prompts.

#### Returns

- A wrapped function that, when called, executes the test.

### `main`

#### Description

The `main` function is the entry point of the script. It sets the logging level to `WARNING`, runs all the tests collected in `TESTS_TO_RUN`, and exits with a status code indicating success or failure of the tests.

#### Behavior

1. Sets the logging level to `WARNING`.
2. Prints the number of tests to run.
3. Executes each test function in `TESTS_TO_RUN` and counts the number of failures.
4. If all tests pass, prints a success message and exits with status code 0.
5. If any test fails, prints the number of failed tests and exits with status code 1.

## Usage

To use this module, a developer would:

1. Import the `prompttest` decorator.
2. Define a completion function that takes a prompt and returns a completion.
3. Annotate the completion function with the `prompttest` decorator, providing the necessary parameters.
4. Call the `main` function to execute all defined tests.

The `prompttest` decorator will automatically add the test to the `TESTS_TO_RUN` list. When the `main` function is called, it will iterate over this list and execute each test, reporting the results accordingly.
