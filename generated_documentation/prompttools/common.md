# Common Configuration Module

## Overview

The `common.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It serves as a configuration utility that sets up environment-specific variables for the rest of the project. This module is responsible for loading environment variables from a `.env` file and defining the `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` based on the current environment.

## Dependencies

- `os`: A standard Python module that provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
- `os.path`: A submodule of `os` that provides a way of manipulating file paths.
- `dotenv`: An optional third-party package that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `os.environ`.

## Environment Variable Loading

The module attempts to import `load_dotenv` from the `dotenv` package. If the import fails (e.g., if `dotenv` is not installed), `load_dotenv` is set to `None`.

If `load_dotenv` is available, the module constructs a path to the `.env` file by joining the directory name two levels up from the current file (`__file__`) with the `.env` filename. This path is then used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file into the system environment variables.

## Environment Configuration

The module defines a variable `ENV` that fetches the value of the environment variable `ENV` from the system environment variables, defaulting to `"prod"` if it is not set.

Based on the value of `ENV`, the module sets the `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` variable:

- If `ENV` is equal to `"development"`, `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` is set to the local development server URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- If `ENV` is not `"development"`, `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` is set to the production server URL `https://api.hegel-ai.com`.

## Usage

Other modules within the `documentation-generator` project can import `common.py` to access the `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` variable. This allows for consistent access to the backend URL that is appropriate for the current environment (development or production).

## File Structure

- The module is located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/common.py` within the project directory structure.

## License

The source code's license information is indicated to be in the `LICENSE` file located in the root directory of the source tree. The copyright notice at the beginning of the file states that the code is owned by "Hegel AI, Inc." and that all rights are reserved.

## Example

Here is an example of how another module within the project might use `common.py`:

```python
from prompttools.common import HEGEL_BACKEND_URL

def fetch_data():
    response = requests.get(HEGEL_BACKEND_URL + '/data-endpoint')
    return response.json()
```

In this example, the `fetch_data` function uses the `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` to construct the full URL to a hypothetical data endpoint and fetches data from it.
```
