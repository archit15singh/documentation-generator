# `selector` Module

## Overview

The `selector` module is a component of the `documentation-generator` project, located within the `prompttools` package. This module is designed to provide functionality for selecting specific elements or data based on certain criteria within the scope of the documentation generation process.

## File Structure

The file is located at the following path within the project:

```
/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/selector/__init__.py
```

This indicates that the `selector` module is a package with its own `__init__.py` file, which may be used to initialize the package and define what is exposed to the outside when the package is imported.

## Licensing

The file begins with a copyright notice and a reference to the license under which the source code is released:

```python
# Copyright (c) Hegel AI, Inc.
# All rights reserved.
#
# This source code's license can be found in the
# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
```

Users and contributors must refer to the `LICENSE` file in the root directory of the source tree to understand their rights and limitations under the license.

## Usage

As an `__init__.py` file, its primary use is to initialize the `selector` package. This can involve several tasks:

1. Importing necessary classes, functions, or submodules from within the package or from external packages.
2. Defining any package-level variables or constants.
3. Setting up any required state or configuration needed by the package.
4. Exposing a public API for the package by specifying which classes, functions, or objects will be available when the package is imported elsewhere in the project.

The `__init__.py` file may also contain package-level documentation strings (docstrings) that describe the purpose and usage of the package.

## Integration with the Project

The `selector` module would be used by other parts of the `documentation-generator` project that require selection logic. For example, it might be used to:

- Select specific code blocks for which documentation should be generated.
- Filter out elements that do not meet certain criteria from the documentation process.
- Choose templates or formats based on the type of code or documentation being generated.

Other modules or scripts within the `documentation-generator` project would import the `selector` package and utilize its exposed functions or classes to perform the necessary selection tasks.

## Extensibility

The structure of the `selector` module as a package allows for extensibility. Additional submodules, classes, or functions can be added to the package to extend its functionality. These can then be imported within the `__init__.py` file to make them part of the package's public API.

## Conclusion

This file serves as the entry point for the `selector` package within the `prompttools` namespace of the `documentation-generator` project. It is responsible for initializing the package and defining its public interface, which other parts of the project will use to perform selection-related tasks during the documentation generation process.
