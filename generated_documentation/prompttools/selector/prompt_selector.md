# PromptSelector Class

## Overview

The `PromptSelector` class is designed to facilitate the rendering of prompts for various language models. It provides a unified interface to generate prompts that are compatible with different models such as OpenAI's Chat models, Llama models, and others.

## Attributes

- `instruction`: A string representing the instruction or context to be provided to the model.
- `user_input`: An object representing the user's input that will be included in the prompt.

## Methods

### `for_openai_chat`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for OpenAI's Chat models.
- **Returns**: A list of dictionaries, each containing a "role" key (either "system" or "user") and a "content" key with the corresponding text.

### `for_openai_completion`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for OpenAI's text completion models.
- **Returns**: A string formatted using the `GENERIC_TEMPLATE`, which includes placeholders for the instruction and user input.

### `for_huggingface_hub`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for models hosted on Hugging Face's Model Hub.
- **Returns**: A string formatted using the `GENERIC_TEMPLATE`, similar to the `for_openai_completion` method.

### `for_llama`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for Llama models.
- **Returns**: A string formatted using the `LLAMA_TEMPLATE`, which includes special tokens and placeholders for the instruction and user input.

### `for_anthropic`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for Anthropic's models.
- **Returns**: A string formatted using the `ANTHROPIC_TEMPLATE`, which includes the `HUMAN_PROMPT` and `AI_PROMPT` tokens if available, along with placeholders for the instruction and user input.

### `for_palm`

- **Description**: Generates a prompt formatted for PALM models.
- **Returns**: A string formatted using the `PALM_TEMPLATE`, which includes placeholders for the instruction and user input.

## Templates

The class uses predefined templates for generating prompts for different models:

- `GENERIC_TEMPLATE`: A basic template that includes an "INSTRUCTION" section followed by a "PROMPT" section and a "RESPONSE" section.
- `PALM_TEMPLATE`: A template for PALM models that directly concatenates the instruction and user input.
- `LLAMA_TEMPLATE`: A template for Llama models that includes special tokens `[INST]`, `<<SYS>>`, and `[/INST]` to delineate the instruction from the user input.
- `ANTHROPIC_TEMPLATE`: A template for Anthropic models that includes `HUMAN_PROMPT` and `AI_PROMPT` tokens to frame the instruction and user input.

## Usage

The `PromptSelector` class is instantiated with an instruction and user input. The appropriate method is then called to generate a prompt for the desired model, which can be used to interact with the model's API or interface.

## Error Handling

The class attempts to import `HUMAN_PROMPT` and `AI_PROMPT` from the `anthropic` module. If the module is not found, it sets these variables to `None`. This allows the `for_anthropic` method to function without these tokens if they are not available.
