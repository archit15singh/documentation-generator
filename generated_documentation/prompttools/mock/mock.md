# Mock Functions for Testing and Demonstration

## Overview

The file `mock.py` contains a collection of mock functions designed to simulate the behavior of various APIs and libraries for testing and demonstration purposes. These functions are typically used in place of actual API calls during development, testing, or when showcasing features without the need for live data or services.

## Dependencies

- `json`: A built-in Python module used for encoding and decoding JSON data.
- `cv2`: An optional module for computer vision tasks, part of the OpenCV library. If not installed, `cv2` is set to `None`.

## Classes

### DotDict

A subclass of `dict` that allows attribute-style access to dictionary keys.

#### Methods

- `__getattr__(self, key)`: Attempts to retrieve the value associated with `key`. If the key does not exist or its value is `None`, it raises an `AttributeError`.

### _mock_Anthropic_Completion_Object

A simple class to represent a completion object from the Anthropic API.

#### Attributes

- `completion`: A string representing the completion text.
- `model`: A string indicating the model used for the completion.
- `stop_reason`: A string describing the reason the completion stopped.

### _mock_PaLM_Completion_Object

A class to represent a completion object from the PaLM API.

#### Attributes

- `candidates`: A list of dictionaries containing completion candidates and their safety ratings.
- `result`: A string representing the final selected completion.
- `filters`: A list of filters applied to the completion process (optional).
- `safety_feedback`: A list of safety feedback items (optional).

## Mock Functions

### mock_openai_chat_completion_fn

Simulates the response from OpenAI's chat completion API.

#### Returns

- A `DotDict` object with predefined chat completion data.

### mock_openai_chat_function_completion_fn

Simulates the response from OpenAI's chat function completion API, including a function call within the chat.

#### Returns

- A `DotDict` object with predefined chat function completion data.

### mock_openai_completion_fn

Simulates the response from OpenAI's text completion API.

#### Returns

- A `DotDict` object with predefined text completion data.

### mock_hf_completion_fn

Simulates the response from Hugging Face's text completion API.

#### Returns

- A list containing a dictionary with the key `generated_text` and a sample completion.

### mock_chromadb_fn

Simulates the response from a database query, such as ChromaDB.

#### Returns

- A dictionary with keys `ids`, `embeddings`, `documents`, `metadatas`, and `distances`, containing sample data.

### mock_anthropic_completion_fn

Simulates the response from Anthropic's text completion API.

#### Returns

- An instance of `_mock_Anthropic_Completion_Object` with predefined data.

### mock_palm_completion_fn

Simulates the response from Google's PaLM text completion API.

#### Returns

- An instance of `_mock_PaLM_Completion_Object` with predefined data.

### mock_mindsdb_completion_fn

Simulates the response from MindsDB's text completion API.

#### Returns

- A list containing a sample completion string.

### mock_lc_completion_fn

Simulates the response from an unspecified text completion API.

#### Returns

- A string containing a sample completion.

### mock_stable_diffusion

Simulates the generation of an image using the Stable Diffusion model.

#### Returns

- The result of `cv2.imread` with a predefined image path.

#### Exceptions

- Raises `ModuleNotFoundError` if `cv2` is not installed.

### mock_replicate_stable_diffusion_completion_fn

Simulates the response from the Stable Diffusion model hosted on Replicate.

#### Parameters

- `model_version`: A string indicating the version of the model used.

#### Returns

- A list containing a predefined image path.

### mock_qdrant_fn

Simulates the response from a Qdrant vector database query.

#### Returns

- A list containing an instance of `ScoredPoint` with predefined data.

## Usage

These mock functions are used in place of actual API calls to simulate responses for testing and demonstration. They can be called with any arguments, as they do not process input parameters and return static, predefined data.

## Notes

- The mock functions do not perform any real data processing or API communication.
- The `cv2` dependency is only required for the `mock_stable_diffusion` function.
- The `qdrant_client` module is assumed to be available for the `mock_qdrant_fn` function.
