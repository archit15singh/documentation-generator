# Logger Module

## Overview

The `logger.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package, specifically within the `logger` subpackage. It provides functionality for logging and sending feedback data to a remote backend service. The module includes a `Logger` class that handles the queuing and asynchronous transmission of log data, as well as a logging wrapper function for the OpenAI API client.

## Dependencies

- `json`: Used for encoding data into JSON format.
- `uuid`: Generates unique identifiers for log entries.
- `requests`: Sends HTTP requests to the remote backend service.
- `threading`: Manages concurrent execution of the logging process.
- `queue`: Provides a thread-safe queue for storing log data.
- `functools.partial`: Used to create a partial function with pre-filled arguments.
- `openai`: The OpenAI API client library.
- `os`: Accesses environment variables.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `os.path`: Handles file path operations.
- `time.perf_counter`: Measures execution time for performance monitoring.
- `prompttools.common`: Contains common utilities and configurations, such as the backend URL.

## Logger Class

### Attributes

- `backend_url`: The URL endpoint for sending log data to the remote backend service.
- `data_queue`: A thread-safe queue for storing log data before it is sent.
- `feedback_queue`: A thread-safe queue for storing feedback data before it is sent.
- `worker_thread`: A thread that processes and sends data from the queues to the backend.

### Methods

- `__init__`: Initializes the logger instance, starts the worker thread, and ensures the worker thread stops when the main thread ends.
- `add_feedback`: Adds feedback data to the `feedback_queue`.
- `add_to_queue`: Adds log data to the `data_queue`.
- `execute_and_add_to_queue`: Executes a callable function, measures its latency, and adds the result to the log queue.
- `wrap`: Wraps a callable function so that its execution is logged.
- `worker`: Continuously processes data from the `data_queue` and `feedback_queue`, sending it to the remote backend.
- `log_data_to_remote`: Sends log data to the remote backend service.
- `send_feedback_to_remote`: Sends feedback data to the remote backend service.

### Usage

- The `Logger` class is instantiated as a global `sender` object.
- The `worker` method runs in a separate thread to handle asynchronous logging.

## Logging Wrapper Function

- `logging_wrapper`: A decorator function that wraps the OpenAI API client's methods to log their execution and results.

### Usage

- The `logging_wrapper` is applied to the `openai.chat.completions.create` method to log calls to the OpenAI API.

## Monkey-Patching

- The module attempts to monkey-patch the `openai.chat.completions.create` method and the `openai.resources.chat.completions.Completions.create` method of the OpenAI API client with the logging functionality provided by the `Logger` class and the `logging_wrapper` function.

## Feedback Function

- `add_feedback`: A convenience function that allows external modules to add feedback data to the logger.

## Environment Variables

- The module loads the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable from a `.env` file located relative to the module's file path.

## Error Handling

- The module includes error handling for issues that may arise during the monkey-patching process or when sending data to the remote backend service.

## Backend Service Communication

- The logger communicates with the backend service defined by `HEGEL_BACKEND_URL` using HTTP POST requests with appropriate headers, including authorization using the `HEGELAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Performance Monitoring

- The module measures the latency of function calls to provide performance metrics as part of the logged data.

## Shutdown Mechanism

- A shutdown mechanism is implemented by inserting `None` into the queues, signaling the worker thread to terminate when the main thread joins (i.e., when the program is exiting).

## Thread Safety

- The module ensures thread safety by using queues and threading mechanisms to manage concurrent access to shared resources.

## Extensibility

- The `Logger` class and the `logging_wrapper` function are designed to be easily applied to other callable functions or methods that require logging, making the module extensible for various use cases within the project.
