# `logger` Module

## Overview

The `logger` module provides logging functionality for the project. It is designed to facilitate the creation of log messages and potentially collect user feedback. The module is contained within the `prompttools/logger` directory.

## Components

The module consists of the following components:

- `Logger`: A class that encapsulates the logging logic.
- `add_feedback`: A function that allows for the addition of user feedback to the logs.

## Usage

### Importing

To use the `logger` module in the project, the relevant classes and functions must be imported:

```python
from prompttools.logger import Logger, add_feedback
```

### `Logger` Class

#### Description

The `Logger` class is responsible for creating log messages. It likely includes methods to log at different levels (e.g., info, warning, error) and to handle the formatting and output of log messages.

#### Methods

The class may include, but is not limited to, the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes a new instance of the `Logger` class.
- `info`: Logs an informational message.
- `warning`: Logs a warning message.
- `error`: Logs an error message.
- `debug`: Logs a debug message.

#### Example

```python
logger = Logger()
logger.info("This is an informational message.")
```

### `add_feedback` Function

#### Description

The `add_feedback` function is used to collect and log user feedback. This function may be called when the application needs to record the user's input or reactions, possibly for analytics or improvement purposes.

#### Parameters

The function likely takes parameters that include the feedback message and any relevant metadata.

#### Example

```python
add_feedback("User found the interface intuitive.", user_id=12345)
```
