# HuggingFaceHubExperiment Class

## Overview
`HuggingFaceHubExperiment` is a subclass of `Experiment` designed to interact with the Hugging Face Hub's API. It is used to perform experiments by sending prompts to various models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub and collecting the responses. The class supports running experiments with different combinations of model parameters and prompt inputs by creating a cartesian product of the provided arguments.

## Attributes
- `MODEL_PARAMETERS`: A list of parameter names related to the model configuration.
- `CALL_PARAMETERS`: A list of parameter names related to the API call configuration.
- `model_params`: A dictionary containing model-related parameters such as `repo_id` and `task`.
- `call_params`: A dictionary containing parameters for the API call, including `prompt` and any additional keyword arguments.
- `prompt_keys`: A dictionary mapping prompts to their corresponding keys, used when prompts are instances of `PromptSelector`.
- `all_args`: A dictionary containing all arguments, a combination of `model_params` and `call_params`.
- `model_argument_combos`: A list of dictionaries representing all possible combinations of model-related arguments.
- `call_argument_combos`: A list of dictionaries representing all possible combinations of call-related arguments.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, repo_id: List[str], prompt: Union[List[str], List[PromptSelector]], task: List[str] = ["text-generation"], **kwargs: Dict[str, list[object]])`
Constructor for the `HuggingFaceHubExperiment` class. It initializes the experiment with the provided repository IDs, prompts, tasks, and additional keyword arguments. If the `huggingface_hub` package is not installed, it raises a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### `prepare(self) -> None`
Prepares the experiment by generating all possible combinations of model and call arguments using the cartesian product.

### `hf_completion_fn(self, **params: Dict[str, Any])`
A helper function that makes a request to the Hugging Face Hub API using the provided parameters. It extracts the necessary arguments from `params` and sends a request to the API client.

### `run(self, runs: int = 1) -> None`
Executes the experiment for each combination of arguments. It performs the experiment `runs` times for each combination (default is 1). The method initializes an `InferenceApi` client for each model configuration and sends the prompts to the API. It measures the latency for each call and collects the results. If no results are obtained, it logs an error and raises a `PromptExperimentException`.

### `_extract_responses(output: List[Dict[str, object]]) -> list[str]`
A static method that extracts the generated text from the API response. It is used to process the output of the API calls and retrieve the generated text from the list of choices.

## Usage
The `HuggingFaceHubExperiment` class is used to conduct experiments with models on the Hugging Face Hub. Users can specify different model repositories, tasks, and prompts, along with other parameters, to test the performance and output of the models. The class handles the complexity of making multiple API calls with different combinations of inputs and collecting the results for analysis.

## Exceptions
- Raises `ModuleNotFoundError` if the `huggingface_hub` package is not installed.
- Raises `PromptExperimentException` if no results are obtained during the experiment run.

## Dependencies
- `os`: To access environment variables and check for debug mode.
- `itertools`: To create cartesian products of input arguments.
- `huggingface_hub.inference_api`: To interact with the Hugging Face Hub API.
- `time.perf_counter`: To measure the latency of API calls.
- `logging`: To log information and errors.
- `prompttools.selector.prompt_selector`: To handle prompt selection if `PromptSelector` instances are used.
- `prompttools.mock.mock`: To provide a mock completion function for debugging purposes.
- `experiment`: To inherit from the `Experiment` base class.
- `error`: To handle custom exceptions specific to the experiment.

## Environment Variables
- `DEBUG`: Determines whether to use the mock completion function instead of the actual Hugging Face Hub API.
- `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`: The API token used to authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub API.

## Notes
- The class assumes that all arguments provided to the constructor are lists, even if they contain a single element. This is necessary for the cartesian product generation.
- The class supports the use of `PromptSelector` instances to handle prompts that require rendering or mapping to other models.
- The `VALID_TASKS` constant defines the supported tasks for the experiment.
