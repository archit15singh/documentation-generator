## `error.py` Module

### Overview

The `error.py` module is part of the `prompttools/experiment` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It defines a custom exception class that is intended to be used across the prompt experiment sub-system of the project.

### Custom Exception Class

#### `PromptExperimentException`

- **Inherits From**: `Exception`
- **Purpose**: This class provides a specific exception type that can be raised to indicate an error or unexpected behavior specifically within the context of prompt experiments. It is designed to signal issues related to the setup or execution of experiments involving prompts.
- **Usage**:
  - This exception should be raised when an error condition is encountered that is specific to the prompt experiment workflow. For example, if an experiment configuration is invalid or if there is a failure in initializing an experiment, this exception could be raised.
  - By using a custom exception, the codebase allows for more granular error handling. Catch blocks can be tailored to handle `PromptExperimentException` differently from other exceptions, providing more context-specific error handling.
- **Attributes**: The class does not define any additional attributes beyond those provided by its superclass, `Exception`.
- **Methods**: The class does not define any methods. It inherits the `__init__` and `__str__` methods from `Exception`, which are sufficient for creating an instance of the exception with an optional error message and converting the exception to a string, respectively.

### Example Usage

```python
def initialize_experiment(config):
    if not validate_config(config):
        raise PromptExperimentException("Experiment configuration is invalid.")

try:
    initialize_experiment(experiment_config)
except PromptExperimentException as e:
    print(f"Failed to initialize experiment: {e}")
```

In the example above, `PromptExperimentException` is raised when the `initialize_experiment` function detects an invalid configuration. The exception is then caught and handled, with an error message being printed to the console.

### Integration with Project

The `error.py` module is expected to be imported and used by other modules within the `prompttools/experiment` package or by any other component of the `documentation-generator` project that deals with prompt experiments. The custom exception allows for consistent error handling and reporting throughout the experiment subsystem.
