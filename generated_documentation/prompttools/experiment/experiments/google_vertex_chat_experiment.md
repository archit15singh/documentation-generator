# GoogleVertexChatCompletionExperiment Class

## Overview

The `GoogleVertexChatCompletionExperiment` class is designed to facilitate experiments with Google Vertex AI's chat API. It inherits from the `Experiment` base class and is used to test different configurations of chat model parameters by creating a cartesian product of the provided argument lists. The class then retrieves results for each combination of arguments.

## Requirements

- The `vertexai` package must be installed to use the Google Vertex AI API within this experiment.
- Google Vertex AI credentials must be set up properly before executing this experiment.

## Attributes

- `completion_fn`: A reference to the `vertex_chat_completion_fn` method, which is used to send messages to the chat model and receive responses.
- `all_args`: A dictionary containing all the arguments that will be passed to the chat model. These arguments include `model`, `message`, `context`, `examples`, `temperature`, `max_output_tokens`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `stop_sequences`.

## Constructor Arguments

- `model`: A list of strings or `types.Model` objects specifying which chat model to use.
- `message`: A list of strings representing the messages for the chat model to respond to.
- `context`: An optional list of strings that shape how the model responds throughout the conversation.
- `examples`: An optional list of `InputOutputTextPair` lists that provide examples for the model to learn from.
- `temperature`: An optional list of floats controlling the randomness of the output.
- `max_output_tokens`: An optional list of integers specifying the maximum number of tokens in a candidate response.
- `top_p`: An optional list of floats configuring the nucleus sampling for the chat model.
- `top_k`: An optional list of integers setting the maximum number of tokens to sample from on each step.
- `stop_sequences`: An optional list of strings or iterables of strings that, when detected, will stop the generation of output.

## Methods

### `vertex_chat_completion_fn`

This method is responsible for creating a chat model instance using the provided `model` name, sending a `message` to the model, and returning the model's response. It takes care of copying the input arguments, excluding `model` and `message`, and passing them to the `start_chat` method of the `ChatModel`.

#### Parameters

- `**input_args`: A variable number of keyword arguments that are used to configure the chat model.

#### Returns

- The response from the chat model after sending the message.

### `_extract_responses`

A static method that extracts the top response from the chat model's output.

#### Parameters

- `response`: The response object from the chat model.

#### Returns

- A list of strings containing the top response from the chat model.

### `_get_model_names`

This method retrieves a list of model names from the argument combinations generated for the experiment.

#### Returns

- A list of strings representing the model names used in the experiment.

### `_get_prompts`

This method retrieves a list of prompts (messages) from the argument combinations generated for the experiment.

#### Returns

- A list of strings representing the prompts used in the experiment.

## Usage

To use the `GoogleVertexChatCompletionExperiment` class, instantiate it with the required lists of arguments, ensuring that each argument is provided as a list to allow for the creation of argument combinations. Once instantiated, the experiment can be run to test the chat model's responses across the different configurations.

## Notes

- The class assumes that all arguments are provided as lists, even if a single value is to be tested (e.g., `temperature=[1.0]`).
- The class will raise a `ModuleNotFoundError` if the `vertexai` package is not installed.
- The class does not handle the setup of Google Vertex AI credentials, which must be done prior to using the class.
