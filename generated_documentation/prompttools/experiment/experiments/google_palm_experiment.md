# GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment Class

## Overview

The `GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment` class is designed to facilitate experiments with Google's PaLM (Pathways Language Model) text generation API. It allows users to pass lists of arguments to the API, creating a cartesian product of those arguments to test various combinations and analyze the generated text output.

## Requirements

- The `google.generativeai` package must be installed to interact with the PaLM API.
- An API key must be set in the environment variable `GOOGLE_PALM_API_KEY` to authenticate requests to the API.

## Attributes

- `completion_fn`: A function that calls the PaLM API to generate text. It points to `mock_palm_completion_fn` if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set, otherwise, it points to `palm_completion_fn`.
- `all_args`: A dictionary containing all the arguments that will be passed to the PaLM API. It includes model, prompt, temperature, candidate_count, max_output_tokens, top_p, top_k, safety_settings, and stop_sequences.

## Methods

### `__init__`

The constructor initializes the experiment with the provided arguments. It validates the presence of the `google.generativeai` package and sets up the completion function based on the debug mode. It also processes prompt selectors if provided.

#### Parameters

- `model`: A list of strings specifying which model to use.
- `prompt`: A list of strings or `PromptSelector` instances for the input text.
- `temperature`: A list of floats controlling the randomness of the output.
- `candidate_count`: A list of integers specifying the maximum number of responses to return.
- `max_output_tokens`: A list of integers defining the maximum number of tokens per candidate.
- `top_p`: A list of floats for nucleus sampling configuration.
- `top_k`: A list of floats for top-k sampling configuration.
- `safety_settings`: A list of `palm.types.SafetySettingDict` for blocking unsafe content.
- `stop_sequences`: A list of strings or iterables of strings that will stop output generation.

### `palm_completion_fn`

This method is a wrapper around the `palm.generate_text` function, which sends the request to the PaLM API with the provided input arguments.

#### Parameters

- `**input_args`: A variable number of keyword arguments that are passed to the PaLM API.

#### Returns

The response from the PaLM API.

### `_extract_responses`

A static method that extracts the generated text responses from the PaLM API's completion response.

#### Parameters

- `completion_response`: A `palm.text.text_types.Completion` object containing the API response.

#### Returns

A list of strings, each representing a generated text response.

### `_get_model_names`

Extracts the model names from the argument combinations prepared for the experiment.

#### Returns

A list of strings, each representing a model name used in the experiment.

### `_get_prompts`

Extracts the prompts from the argument combinations prepared for the experiment.

#### Returns

A list of strings, each representing a prompt used in the experiment.

## Usage

To use the `GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment` class, instantiate it with the desired argument lists and call the methods to perform the text generation experiment. Ensure that the required environment variable for the API key is set and that the `google.generativeai` package is installed and configured correctly.

## Notes

- The class is designed to handle multiple combinations of input arguments, allowing for extensive testing of the PaLM API's capabilities.
- The class assumes that all arguments are provided as lists, even if a single value is used (e.g., `temperature=[1.0]`).
- The class can be extended or modified to include additional methods for analyzing the generated text or for integrating with other components of a project.
