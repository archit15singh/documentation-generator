# MistralChatCompletionExperiment Class

## Overview

The `MistralChatCompletionExperiment` class is a subclass of the `Experiment` class, designed to facilitate experiments with Mistral's chat completion API. It allows users to pass lists of arguments to the API, generating a cartesian product of these arguments to test various combinations and retrieve results for each.

## Requirements

- The `mistralai` Python package must be installed. If not present, the class initialization will fail with a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- An API key for Mistral's API must be set as an environment variable (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`).

## Attributes

- `url`: A class-level attribute that stores the URL endpoint for the Mistral chat completion API.

## Initialization

The constructor of the `MistralChatCompletionExperiment` class takes the following parameters:

- `model`: A list of strings specifying the model(s) to use for prompt completion (e.g., "mistral-tiny").
- `messages`: A list of `ChatMessage` objects representing the input prompts. The first prompt role should be `user` or `system`.
- `temperature`: An optional list of floats that control the randomness of the response. Defaults to `[None]`.
- `top_p`: An optional list of floats for nucleus sampling. Defaults to `[None]`.
- `max_tokens`: A list of integers or `None` values indicating the maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
- `safe_prompt`: A list of booleans indicating whether to prepend a safety prompt before all conversations. Defaults to `[False]`.
- `random_seed`: An optional list of integers or `None` values for deterministic random sampling. Defaults to `[None]`.

During initialization, the constructor:

1. Checks if the `mistralai` package is installed and raises an error if it is not.
2. Initializes a `MistralClient` with the API key from the environment variable.
3. Sets the `completion_fn` attribute to the instance method `mistral_completion_fn`.
4. Stores all constructor arguments in the `all_args` dictionary.
5. Calls the superclass constructor to complete the initialization.

## Methods

### mistral_completion_fn

This instance method takes keyword arguments (`**input_args`) and passes them to the `chat` method of the `MistralClient` instance. It returns the response from the API call.

### _extract_responses

A static method that extracts the content of the messages from the API response. It takes a `response` object and returns a list of strings containing the message contents.

### _get_model_names

An instance method that retrieves the model names from the argument combinations generated for the experiment. It returns a list of model names.

### _get_prompts

An instance method that retrieves the prompts from the argument combinations generated for the experiment. It returns a list of prompts.

## Usage

To use the `MistralChatCompletionExperiment` class in a project:

1. Ensure the `mistralai` package is installed and the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable is set.
2. Instantiate the class with the desired parameters.
3. Call the `run` method inherited from the `Experiment` superclass to execute the experiment with all combinations of arguments.
4. Use the `_extract_responses` method to process the results from the experiment.

## Notes

- All constructor arguments except `model` and `messages` have default values, allowing them to be optional.
- The `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, and `random_seed` parameters accept `None` to indicate the use of default behavior in the API.
- The `safe_prompt` parameter is a boolean that determines whether a safety prompt is used, which can be important for content moderation.
- The class is designed to work with the cartesian product of input arguments, meaning that it will try every possible combination of the provided lists.
