# AnthropicCompletionExperiment Class

## Overview

The `AnthropicCompletionExperiment` class is a Python class that extends the `Experiment` class, designed to interact with Anthropic's completion API. It is used to conduct experiments by generating a cartesian product of input arguments and obtaining results for each combination from the API.

## Dependencies

- The class requires the `anthropic` package to be installed. If not present, an `ImportError` will be raised.
- The `os` module is used to access environment variables.
- The `logging` module is used for logging errors and information.
- The `prompttools.selector.prompt_selector` and `prompttools.mock.mock` modules are used for prompt selection and mocking the API for testing purposes.

## Environment Variables

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Must be set in the environment to authenticate with the Anthropic API.

## Initialization

The constructor of the `AnthropicCompletionExperiment` class takes the following parameters:

- `model`: A list of strings specifying the model(s) to use for completion.
- `prompt`: A list of strings or `PromptSelector` objects representing the input prompts.
- `metadata`: A list of objects describing metadata about the request. Defaults to `[NOT_GIVEN]`.
- `max_tokens_to_sample`: A list of integers indicating the maximum number of tokens to generate. Defaults to `[1000]`.
- `stop_sequences`: A list of lists of strings representing sequences that will stop the model from generating more text. Defaults to `[NOT_GIVEN]`.
- `stream`: A list of booleans indicating whether to stream the response. Defaults to `[False]`.
- `temperature`: A list of floats representing the randomness in the response. Defaults to `[NOT_GIVEN]`.
- `top_k`: A list of integers for sampling only from the top K options. Defaults to `[NOT_GIVEN]`.
- `top_p`: A list of floats for nucleus sampling. Defaults to `[NOT_GIVEN]`.
- `timeout`: A list of floats indicating the timeout for the request in seconds. Defaults to `[600.0]`.

The constructor checks for the presence of the `anthropic` package and initializes the API client with the provided API key. If the `DEBUG` environment variable is set, a mock completion function is used instead of the actual API call.

## Methods

### anthropic_completion_fn

This instance method makes a call to the Anthropic API with the provided input arguments and handles various exceptions that may occur during the API call, such as connection errors and rate limits.

### _extract_responses

A static method that extracts the completion text from the API response.

### _get_model_names

An instance method that retrieves the model names from the argument combinations.

### _get_prompts

An instance method that retrieves the prompts from the argument combinations.

## Usage

To use the `AnthropicCompletionExperiment` class, instantiate it with the required arguments and call its methods to perform the experiment. Ensure that the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set before creating an instance of the class.

## Error Handling

The class includes error handling for issues such as missing dependencies, API connection errors, rate limiting, and non-200 HTTP status codes.

## Notes

- All arguments to the constructor should be provided as lists, even if they are not intended to vary during the experiment.
- The class is designed to be used in a larger project where experiments are conducted using the Anthropic API.
- The class assumes that the `Experiment` base class and other required modules are available in the project.
