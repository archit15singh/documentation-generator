## OpenAIChatExperiment Class

### Overview

The `OpenAIChatExperiment` class is designed to facilitate experiments with OpenAI's chat completion API. It allows users to specify various parameters as lists, and then it generates a cartesian product of these parameters to test different combinations. The class is capable of handling both standard and Azure OpenAI service configurations.

### Attributes

- `_experiment_type`: A string indicating the type of experiment, set to `"RawExperiment"`.

### Constructor

The `__init__` method initializes the `OpenAIChatExperiment` with the following parameters:

- `model`: A list of model IDs to be used for the experiment.
- `messages`: A list of dictionaries representing the conversation history, or a list of `PromptSelector` objects.
- `temperature`: A list of floats representing the sampling temperature.
- `top_p`: A list of floats for nucleus sampling.
- `n`: A list of integers indicating the number of chat completions to generate.
- `stream`: A list of booleans indicating whether to stream partial message deltas.
- `stop`: A list of lists containing stop sequences.
- `max_tokens`: A list of integers specifying the maximum number of tokens to generate.
- `presence_penalty`: A list of floats for presence penalty.
- `frequency_penalty`: A list of floats for frequency penalty.
- `logit_bias`: A list of dictionaries to modify token likelihoods.
- `response_format`: A list of dictionaries to enable JSON mode.
- `seed`: A list of integers for deterministic sampling.
- `functions`: A list of dictionaries defining functions for the model to generate JSON inputs.
- `function_call`: A list of dictionaries specifying a function call.
- `azure_openai_service_configs`: An optional dictionary for Azure OpenAI service configuration.

### Methods

#### `_extract_responses`

Static method that extracts the content from the chat completion output.

#### `_is_chat`

Static method that returns `True`, indicating that this is a chat experiment.

#### `_get_model_names`

Returns a list of model names from the argument combinations.

#### `_get_prompts`

Returns a list of prompts corresponding to the argument combinations.

#### `_get_state`

Captures the current state of the experiment, including DataFrame columns and parameters.

#### `save_experiment`

Saves the current state of the experiment to the backend.

#### `load_experiment`

Class method to load an experiment from the backend using an experiment ID.

#### `load_revision`

Class method to load a specific revision of an experiment from the backend using a revision ID.

#### `_load_state`

Class method to reconstruct an experiment from a saved state.

#### `_validate_arg_key`

Validates if a provided argument name matches known argument names.

#### `run_partial`

Runs the experiment with a single parameter, appending the result to existing DataFrames.

#### `run_one`

Executes a single configuration of the experiment and adds the result to the DataFrame.

#### `get_table`

Returns a DataFrame with the results of the experiment, optionally hiding certain columns.

### Usage

To use the `OpenAIChatExperiment` class, instantiate it with the desired parameters and call the `run_partial` or `run_one` methods to execute the experiment. Results can be saved and loaded using the `save_experiment`, `load_experiment`, and `load_revision` methods. The `get_table` method can be used to retrieve the results in a tabular format.

### Error Handling

The class includes a custom exception `PromptExperimentException` for handling errors specific to the experiment.

### Environment Variables

The class expects the following environment variables to be set:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: The API key for Azure OpenAI service.
- `HEGELAI_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing the backend services.

### Dependencies

The class imports various modules such as `copy`, `os`, `json`, `pickle`, `typing`, `openai`, `requests`, `itertools`, `logging`, `pandas`, and custom modules from the `prompttools` package.

### Notes

- The class is designed to work with OpenAI's chat completion API and may require updates as the API evolves.
- The class assumes that all arguments are provided as lists to facilitate the cartesian product generation.
- The class handles both standard and Azure OpenAI service configurations, with the ability to mock responses for debugging purposes.
- The class is part of a larger project structure and interacts with backend services for saving and loading experiments.
