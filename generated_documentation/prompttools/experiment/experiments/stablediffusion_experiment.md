# StableDiffusionExperiment Class

## Overview
`StableDiffusionExperiment` is a class that extends the `Experiment` class, designed to facilitate experimentation with the Stable Diffusion model. It allows for the generation of images based on textual prompts using the Stable Diffusion model and provides functionality to compare the generated images with a set of reference images.

## Dependencies
- `os`: Standard library module for interacting with the operating system.
- `typing`: Module for type hints.
- `itertools`: Module for creating iterators for efficient looping.
- `time.perf_counter`: Function for timing code execution.
- `logging`: Module for logging events.
- `cv2`: OpenCV module for image processing tasks.
- `diffusers`: Library that provides diffusion models including Stable Diffusion.
- `prompttools.mock.mock`: Module containing mock functions for testing.

## Class Attributes
- `MODEL_PARAMETERS`: A list of parameters specific to the model configuration.
- `CALL_PARAMETERS`: A list of parameters used when calling the model to generate images.

## Constructor
The constructor takes the following arguments:
- `hf_model_path`: A list of strings specifying the paths to the model on Hugging Face.
- `prompt`: A list of strings containing prompts for image generation.
- `compare_images_folder`: A string specifying the folder path where comparison images are stored.
- `use_auth_token`: A boolean indicating whether an Hugging Face authentication token is required (necessary when not using a GPU).
- `**kwargs`: A dictionary of additional keyword arguments to configure the model.

The constructor performs the following actions:
1. Checks if the required `diffusers` and `cv2` packages are installed, raising a `ModuleNotFoundError` if not.
2. Initializes instance variables for authentication, image comparison, and model parameters.
3. If in debug mode, sets the completion function to a mock function.
4. Combines model and call parameters into a single dictionary of all arguments.
5. Calls the superclass constructor.

## Methods

### prepare
Prepares combinations of model and call arguments for the experiment by creating Cartesian products of the parameter values.

### sd_completion_fn
A helper function that takes a dictionary of parameters, generates an image using the Stable Diffusion model, and resizes comparison images to match the generated image's size. It returns the main generated image.

### run
Executes the experiment for every combination of model and call arguments. It can run multiple times for each combination, as specified by the `runs` argument. The method performs the following steps:
1. Prepares argument combinations if not already done.
2. Initializes lists for storing results and latencies.
3. Iterates over all model and call argument combinations.
4. Initializes the Stable Diffusion model client with or without an authentication token.
5. Executes the image generation function, measures latency, and stores the results.
6. Constructs result dataframes from the experiment data.

### _extract_responses
A static method that converts the output image to grayscale. This method is used to process the generated images before storing or comparing them.

## Usage
To use the `StableDiffusionExperiment` class, one must instantiate it with the required parameters and then call the `run` method to start the experiment. The class handles the generation of images based on textual prompts and compares them with reference images in the specified folder.

## Exceptions
- `PromptExperimentException`: Custom exception raised if no results are generated during the experiment.

## Notes
- The class assumes that the necessary packages (`diffusers`, `cv2`, etc.) are installed.
- The class is designed to work with GPU acceleration; however, it can also use an authentication token for CPU-based execution.
- The `run` method includes a TODO comment suggesting the implementation of an asynchronous queue for handling the experiment runs.
