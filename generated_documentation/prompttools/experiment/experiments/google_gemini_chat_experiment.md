# GoogleGeminiChatCompletionExperiment Class

## Overview

The `GoogleGeminiChatCompletionExperiment` class is designed to facilitate experiments with Google's Generative AI chat API, specifically through the Vertex AI platform. It allows users to test various configurations of the chat model by creating a cartesian product of provided argument lists and obtaining results for each combination.

## Dependencies

- The class relies on the `google-generativeai` package, which must be installed prior to usage. If the package is not found, the class initialization will raise a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

## Attributes

- `completion_fn`: A reference to the instance method `google_text_completion_fn`, which is responsible for making API calls to the Google GenAI service.
- `all_args`: A dictionary holding all the arguments that will be used to create the cartesian product for the experiment. It includes `model`, `contents`, `generation_config`, and `safety_settings`.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, model, contents, generation_config, safety_settings)`

The constructor for the `GoogleGeminiChatCompletionExperiment` class.

#### Parameters

- `model`: A list of strings or `types.Model` instances specifying which models to call.
- `contents`: A list of `content_types.ContentsType` instances representing the messages for the chat model to respond to.
- `generation_config`: A list of `generation_types.GenerationConfigType` instances or `None` specifying configurations for the generation process.
- `safety_settings`: A list of `safety_types.SafetySettingOptions` instances or `None` specifying configurations for the safety features of the model.

#### Behavior

- Validates the presence of the `google-generativeai` package.
- Initializes the `completion_fn` attribute.
- Stores the provided arguments in the `all_args` attribute.
- Calls the superclass constructor.

### `google_text_completion_fn(self, **input_args)`

An instance method that performs the actual API call to Google GenAI's chat model.

#### Parameters

- `**input_args`: A dictionary of arguments to pass to the chat model.

#### Behavior

- Creates a deep copy of the input arguments to avoid mutating the original data.
- Extracts the model name from the arguments and initializes a `GenerativeModel` instance.
- Removes the model name from the parameters to avoid passing it as an argument to the `generate_content` method.
- Calls the `generate_content` method of the `GenerativeModel` instance with the remaining parameters.
- Returns the response from the API call.

### `_extract_responses(response)`

A static method to extract text responses from the API call result.

#### Parameters

- `response`: The response object returned by the `generate_content` method.

#### Returns

- A list of strings containing the top response from the chat model.

### `_get_model_names(self)`

An instance method to retrieve model names from the argument combinations.

#### Returns

- A list of model names used in the experiment.

### `_get_prompts(self)`

An instance method to retrieve prompts from the argument combinations.

#### Returns

- A list of prompts (messages) used in the experiment.

## Usage

To use the `GoogleGeminiChatCompletionExperiment` class, one must:

1. Ensure that the `google-generativeai` package is installed and Google Vertex AI credentials are properly set up.
2. Instantiate the class with the required arguments, all of which should be provided as lists.
3. Call the `run` method inherited from the `Experiment` superclass to execute the experiment with all combinations of arguments.
4. Use the `_extract_responses` method to parse the responses from the chat model.

## Note

- The class is part of a larger project structure and is expected to be used in conjunction with other modules and classes, particularly those related to experiment management and execution.
- The class assumes that the user has appropriate access to Google Cloud resources and has set up authentication credentials for Vertex AI.
