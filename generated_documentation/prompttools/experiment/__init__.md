# `__init__.py` Module in `experiment` Package

## Overview

The `__init__.py` file serves as the initialization module for the `experiment` package within the `prompttools` namespace of the `documentation-generator` project. This file imports various experiment classes from submodules and makes them available for use throughout the project. It also defines the `__all__` list, which explicitly specifies the symbols that are exported when `from experiment import *` is used.

## Imports

The module imports the following experiment classes from their respective submodules within the `experiments` package:

- `Experiment`: A base class for experiments, likely providing common interfaces or methods for derived experiment classes.
- `OpenAIChatExperiment`: A class for conducting experiments with OpenAI's chat models.
- `OpenAICompletionExperiment`: A class for running experiments using OpenAI's text completion models.
- `AnthropicCompletionExperiment`: A class for experiments involving Anthropic's completion models.
- `HuggingFaceHubExperiment`: A class for experiments that interact with models available on Hugging Face's model hub.
- `GoogleGeminiChatCompletionExperiment`: A class for experiments with Google's Gemini chat and completion models.
- `GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment`: A class for experiments using Google's PaLM completion models.
- `GoogleVertexChatCompletionExperiment`: A class for experiments with Google's Vertex chat models.
- `LlamaCppExperiment`: A class for experiments involving Llama C++ models.
- `ChromaDBExperiment`: A class for experiments with the ChromaDB database.
- `WeaviateExperiment`: A class for experiments using the Weaviate vector search engine.
- `LanceDBExperiment`: A class for experiments involving the LanceDB database.
- `MistralChatCompletionExperiment`: A class for experiments with Mistral's chat and completion models.
- `MindsDBExperiment`: A class for experiments with MindsDB, an open-source predictive database.
- `SequentialChainExperiment`: A class for experiments that involve sequential chaining of models or operations.
- `RouterChainExperiment`: A class for experiments that involve routing between different models or operations based on certain criteria.
- `StableDiffusionExperiment`: A class for experiments with the Stable Diffusion model, likely related to image generation.
- `ReplicateExperiment`: A class for experiments that involve replication of models or data.
- `QdrantExperiment`: A class for experiments with the Qdrant vector search engine.
- `PineconeExperiment`: A class for experiments using Pinecone, a vector database for machine learning applications.

## Exported Symbols

The `__all__` list defines the symbols that are exported when the `experiment` package is imported using the `from experiment import *` syntax. This list includes the names of all the imported experiment classes, ensuring that they are accessible to other modules within the project.

## Usage

Other modules within the `documentation-generator` project can import the `experiment` package and use the experiment classes directly. For example:

```python
from prompttools.experiment import OpenAIChatExperiment

# Initialize an experiment with OpenAI's chat model
experiment = OpenAIChatExperiment(...)
```

This allows for a clean and organized structure where experiment-related classes are encapsulated within the `experiment` package and can be easily reused across the project.
