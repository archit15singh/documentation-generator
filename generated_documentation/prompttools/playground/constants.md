# Constants Module Documentation

## Overview

The `constants.py` module is part of the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/playground` package. It defines several constants used throughout the project, particularly for managing experiments with different AI models and their associated environment variables.

## Imports

The module imports various experiment classes from the `prompttools.experiment` package:

- `LlamaCppExperiment`
- `OpenAIChatExperiment`
- `OpenAICompletionExperiment`
- `AnthropicCompletionExperiment`
- `GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment`
- `HuggingFaceHubExperiment`
- `ReplicateExperiment`

These classes are likely to represent different types of experiments that can be conducted with various AI models.

## Constants

### ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE

A dictionary mapping the name of the experiment to the corresponding environment variable that stores the API token or key required to access the service.

- `"Replicate"` maps to `"REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"`
- `"OpenAI Chat"` maps to `"OPENAI_API_KEY"`
- `"OpenAI Completion"` maps to `"OPENAI_API_KEY"`
- `"Anthropic"` maps to `"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`
- `"Google PaLM"` maps to `"GOOGLE_PALM_API_KEY"`
- `"HuggingFace Hub"` maps to `"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN"`

This dictionary is used to dynamically fetch the correct API token based on the experiment being run.

### EXPERIMENTS

A dictionary mapping the name of the experiment to the experiment class that should be instantiated when running that experiment.

- `"LlamaCpp Chat"` maps to `LlamaCppExperiment`
- `"OpenAI Chat"` maps to `OpenAIChatExperiment`
- `"OpenAI Completion"` maps to `OpenAICompletionExperiment`
- `"Anthropic"` maps to `AnthropicCompletionExperiment`
- `"Google PaLM"` maps to `GooglePaLMCompletionExperiment`
- `"HuggingFace Hub"` maps to `HuggingFaceHubExperiment`
- `"Replicate"` maps to `ReplicateExperiment`

This dictionary is used to instantiate the correct experiment class based on the user's selection.

### MODES

A tuple containing different modes of operation for the experiments:

- `"Instruction"`
- `"Prompt Template"`
- `"Model Comparison"`

These modes likely correspond to different ways the experiments can be configured or the type of input they accept.

### MODEL_TYPES

A tuple listing all the model types that can be used in the experiments:

- `"OpenAI Chat"`
- `"OpenAI Completion"`
- `"Anthropic"`
- `"Google PaLM"`
- `"LlamaCpp Chat"`
- `"LlamaCpp Completion"`
- `"HuggingFace Hub"`
- `"Replicate"`

This tuple is used to validate or display the available model types to the user.

### OPENAI_CHAT_MODELS

A tuple containing the identifiers for different configurations of the OpenAI Chat models:

- `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`
- `"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"`
- `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"`
- `"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"`
- `"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"`
- `"gpt-4"`
- `"gpt-4-0613"`
- `"gpt-4-32k"`
- `"gpt-4-32k-0613"`
- `"gpt-4-0314"`
- `"gpt-4-32k-0314"`

These identifiers are used to specify which OpenAI Chat model to use during an experiment.

### OPENAI_COMPLETION_MODELS

A tuple containing the identifiers for different configurations of the OpenAI Completion models:

- `"text-davinci-003"`
- `"text-davinci-002"`
- `"code-davinci-002"`

These identifiers are used to specify which OpenAI Completion model to use during an experiment.

## Usage

The constants defined in this module are used throughout the project to:

- Dynamically fetch API tokens based on the experiment being run.
- Instantiate the correct experiment class based on user selection.
- Validate or display the available model types to the user.
- Specify the model configuration for OpenAI Chat and Completion experiments.

The module serves as a central repository for configuration options that are likely to be referenced in multiple places within the project, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.
