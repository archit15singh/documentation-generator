# playground.py

## Overview
`playground.py` is a Python script that utilizes the Streamlit library to create an interactive web application for experimenting with different AI models and prompt configurations. It allows users to select models, input prompts, and view the generated responses. The application supports various modes of operation, including single model interaction, prompt templating, and model comparison.

## Dependencies
- `streamlit`: Provides the web application framework.
- `pyperclip`: Allows copying text to the clipboard.
- `urllib.parse`: Used for encoding and decoding URL parameters.
- `os`, `pathlib.Path`: Used for file and directory manipulation.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Constants
- `MODES`, `MODEL_TYPES`, `OPENAI_CHAT_MODELS`, `OPENAI_COMPLETION_MODELS`: Defined in `constants.py`, these constants represent the available modes of operation, model types, and specific models for OpenAI's Chat and Completion APIs.

## Data Handling
- `render_prompts`, `load_data`, `run_multiple`: Functions imported from `data_loader.py` that handle the rendering of prompts, loading of data from models, and running multiple models for comparison.

## Query Parameters
- `params`: Retrieves the current query parameters from the URL.
- `st.experimental_set_query_params()`: Resets the query parameters.

## Streamlit Components
- `st.header`, `st.write`: Display the application title and a link to the GitHub repository.
- `st.sidebar`: Contains the controls for selecting the mode, model type, and other configurations.
- `st.radio`, `st.selectbox`, `st.text_input`, `st.number_input`, `st.slider`, `st.text_area`, `st.button`, `st.columns`, `st.empty`, `st.divider`: Various Streamlit components used to create the user interface.

## Session State Management
- `st.session_state`: A state management system to preserve user input across reruns of the application.

## Modes of Operation
- `Instruction`: Allows users to input instructions and prompts for a single model and view the generated responses.
- `Prompt Template`: Enables users to create prompt templates with variables and generate responses based on user input.
- `Model Comparison`: Facilitates the comparison of responses from multiple models for the same prompts.

## Model Configuration
Depending on the selected mode and model type, users can configure:
- Local model paths for LlamaCpp models.
- Repository IDs for models hosted on HuggingFace Hub.
- Model names for Google PaLM.
- API keys for various services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google PaLM, HuggingFace Hub, Replicate).

## Input Configuration
Users can specify the number of instructions, prompts, and variables, as well as fine-tune parameters like temperature, presence penalty, and frequency penalty.

## Running the Models
- `run`: A button that triggers the generation of responses based on the current configuration.
- `clear`: A button that clears the session state.
- `share`: A button that copies a shareable link with the current configuration to the clipboard.

## Output Display
- `placeholders`: Empty Streamlit components that are later filled with the generated responses from the models.

## Error Handling
- The script includes a try-except block to handle the loading of environment variables and gracefully pass if an exception occurs.

## Clipboard Interaction
- The application attempts to copy the shareable link to the clipboard using `pyperclip`. If this fails, it provides the link as text for manual copying.

## Clearing Session State
- If the clear button is pressed, the script removes all keys from the session state to reset the application.

## Sharing Functionality
- The share button constructs a URL with the current configuration encoded as query parameters and attempts to copy it to the clipboard.

## Usage
To use the application, the user interacts with the sidebar to select the desired mode and model configurations, inputs prompts or templates, and then runs the model to see the generated responses. The application can be accessed through a web browser, typically hosted on a platform that supports Streamlit applications.
