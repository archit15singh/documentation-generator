# `__init__.py` in `prompttools/benchmarks` Module

## Overview

The `__init__.py` file serves as the initialization script for the `prompttools/benchmarks` package within the larger project. This file is executed when the `prompttools/benchmarks` package is imported in a Python script, and it is responsible for setting up the package namespace.

## Contents

The file contains an import statement and a special list named `__all__`.

### Import Statements

```python
from .benchmark import Benchmark
```

This line imports the `Benchmark` class from the `benchmark.py` module located in the same directory as the `__init__.py` file. The `.` before `benchmark` indicates that it is a relative import, meaning that the module is part of the current package.

### `__all__` List

```python
__all__ = [
    "Benchmark",
]
```

The `__all__` list is a mechanism for defining which symbols will be exported when `from prompttools.benchmarks import *` is used. It explicitly declares the public API of the package. In this case, only the `Benchmark` class is made available for import when using the wildcard `*`. This prevents other modules that may be present in the package directory from being imported unintentionally.

## Usage

When a user wants to use the `Benchmark` class in their code, they can import it directly from the `prompttools/benchmarks` package as follows:

```python
from prompttools.benchmarks import Benchmark
```

This import is possible because the `__init__.py` file has explicitly made `Benchmark` available in the package's namespace. Without the import statement in `__init__.py`, the user would have to use a longer import path:

```python
from prompttools.benchmarks.benchmark import Benchmark
```

By using the `__init__.py` file to manage imports, the package provides a cleaner and more convenient API to its users.

## Project Structure

The presence of the `__init__.py` file indicates that `prompttools/benchmarks` is a Python package. This file is part of the standard structure of a Python package and is required for Python to recognize the directory as a package and to allow imports from it.

## Licensing

The file header contains a copyright notice and a reference to the license under which the source code is provided:

```plaintext
# Copyright (c) Hegel AI, Inc.
# All rights reserved.
#
# This source code's license can be found in the
# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
```

This notice informs users and contributors that the code is the property of "Hegel AI, Inc." and that all rights are reserved. It also directs users to the `LICENSE` file for the full license terms, which should be located in the root directory of the source tree.

## Conclusion

The `__init__.py` file in the `prompttools/benchmarks` package is a key component for managing the package's namespace and providing a clean API for importing its contents. It specifies the `Benchmark` class as part of the public interface of the package and adheres to the project's licensing terms.
