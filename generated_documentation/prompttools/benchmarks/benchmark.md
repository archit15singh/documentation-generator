# Benchmark Class

## Overview
The `Benchmark` class is designed to evaluate models using predefined datasets and metrics. It is particularly tailored for benchmarking language models (LLMs) on multiple-choice tasks. The class provides methods to run experiments, calculate accuracy, and potentially other precision metrics (as indicated by the placeholder method `_get_precision`).

## Attributes
- `experiment`: An instance of an experiment class that contains the method `run` to execute the experiment and a DataFrame `full_df` with the results.
- `eval_method`: A callable that takes a row of data and an expected response to evaluate the similarity between model responses and expected responses.
- `prompts`: A list of strings representing queries, questions, or prompts for LLMs to generate responses.
- `response_options`: A list of possible responses for each prompt.
- `correct_response_indices`: An optional list of integers indicating the index of the correct response within `response_options`.

## Methods

### `__init__`
The constructor initializes the `Benchmark` object with the provided experiment, evaluation method, prompts, response options, and correct response indices.

### `_get_precision`
A placeholder method intended to calculate precision from a DataFrame. It is not implemented yet (`TODO: coming soon`).

### `multiple_choice_accuracy`
Calculates the accuracy of the LLM on multiple-choice tasks by comparing the model's choices with the correct answers.

#### Parameters
- `dataframe`: A pandas DataFrame containing the results of the experiment.
- `col1`: The name of the column in the DataFrame that contains the model's choices.
- `col2`: The name of the column in the DataFrame that contains the correct answers.

#### Returns
- A float representing the accuracy of the model's responses.

### `multiple_choice_benchmark`
Executes the experiment using the `experiment` attribute's `run` method and processes the results to measure the quality of the LLM's responses.

#### Steps
1. Runs the experiment using the `experiment` object.
2. Checks if the `prompt` column exists in the `experiment.full_df` DataFrame. If not, it creates the `prompt` column by mapping the `messages` column to strings and issues a warning.
3. Prepares a DataFrame `benchmark_df` with the `prompt` and `response` columns from `experiment.full_df`.
4. Associates each prompt with the list of `response_options`.
5. Explodes the `response_options` column to create a row for each option and resets the index.
6. Iterates over the rows of `benchmark_df` and applies the `eval_method` to calculate similarity scores between the LLM response and each response option.
7. Adds a `scores` column to `benchmark_df` with the calculated similarity scores.
8. Determines the maximum score for each prompt and filters the DataFrame to only include rows with the highest score.
9. Sorts `benchmark_df` by index to maintain the original order.
10. Extracts the model's choices based on the index of the response options and adds a `model_choice` column to `benchmark_df`.
11. Adds a `labels` column to `benchmark_df` with the correct response indices.
12. Calls `multiple_choice_accuracy` with `benchmark_df`, `model_choice`, and `labels` columns to calculate the accuracy.

#### Returns
- The accuracy of the LLM as determined by the `multiple_choice_accuracy` method.

## Usage
The `Benchmark` class is used to evaluate the performance of language models on multiple-choice tasks. An example of its usage can be found in the `benchmarks/examples/benchmarking.ipynb` notebook. The class requires an experiment object that can run a model and collect responses, an evaluation method to score the responses, a set of prompts, response options, and the indices of the correct responses. The main method to use is `multiple_choice_benchmark`, which orchestrates the benchmarking process and returns the accuracy of the model.
