# `version.py` Module

## Overview

The `version.py` module is a part of the `prompttools` package located within the `documentation-generator` project. This module defines the version information for the `prompttools` package, which includes both the semantic version and the Git commit hash that corresponds to the source code state at the time of the version's release.

## Details

### Variables

- `__version__`: A string that represents the semantic version of the `prompttools` package. The semantic version follows the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) specification. The version string is composed of three numerical components separated by dots (`major.minor.patch`), followed by an optional pre-release identifier and build metadata.

  - `major`: The first digit in the version string, indicating the major version. Changes in the major version typically indicate backward-incompatible API changes.
  - `minor`: The second digit, representing the minor version. This is incremented when new, backward-compatible functionality is introduced.
  - `patch`: The third digit, indicating the patch version. This is incremented with backward-compatible bug fixes.
  - `pre-release identifier`: An optional alphanumeric identifier that follows the patch version, starting with a hyphen (e.g., `alpha`, `beta`, `rc` for release candidate). In this case, `45a0` indicates a pre-release version.
  - `build metadata`: Optional metadata following a plus sign, which can include information like the build number or a commit hash. Here, `6151062` is likely a reference to the build or commit hash.

- `git_version`: A string containing the full Git commit hash that the source code corresponds to. This hash can be used to identify the exact state of the source code in the version control system (Git) at the time the version was released.

### Usage

The `version.py` module is typically used in the following ways:

1. **Package Metadata**: The `__version__` variable is used as the version number in the package's metadata, which is often defined in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for Python projects. This metadata is used by package managers like `pip` to manage the installation and dependencies of the package.

2. **Version Display**: The `__version__` variable can be used to display the current version of the `prompttools` package to the user, often through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

3. **Release Management**: The `__version__` and `git_version` variables are used during the release process to tag the repository with the current version number and to ensure that the source code matches the distributed package.

4. **Dependency Resolution**: When other packages or projects list `prompttools` as a dependency, they may specify a particular version or range of versions using the `__version__` string. This ensures compatibility and predictable behavior.

5. **Debugging and Support**: The `git_version` variable is particularly useful for debugging purposes. If an issue arises, developers can use the commit hash to check out the exact state of the codebase that corresponds to the version in use.

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: In automated build and deployment pipelines, the `__version__` and `git_version` variables can be used to tag Docker images, create release notes, and track which version of the code is deployed to different environments.

## File Location

The `version.py` file is located at the following path within the project's directory structure:

```
/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/version.py
```

This path indicates that the file is part of the `target_code` directory under the `prompttools` package within the `documentation-generator` workspace.
