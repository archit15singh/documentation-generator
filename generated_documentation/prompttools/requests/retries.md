# retries.py Module Documentation

## Overview

The `retries.py` module is part of the `prompttools.requests` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It provides a utility to create a retry decorator using the `tenacity` library, which is designed to handle transient errors in network requests by implementing a retry mechanism. This module is particularly useful when dealing with the OpenAI API, as it includes handling for specific OpenAI-related exceptions.

## Functions

### generate_retry_decorator

#### Description

The `generate_retry_decorator` function creates and returns a retry decorator configured with exponential backoff and specific exception handling. This decorator can be applied to functions that perform network requests to automatically retry them in case of certain types of failures, such as connection errors or rate limits.

#### Parameters

- `wait_lower_bound` (int, optional): The minimum amount of time, in seconds, to wait before the first retry attempt. Defaults to 3 seconds.
- `wait_upper_bound` (int, optional): The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the wait time can reach through exponential backoff before a retry attempt. Defaults to 12 seconds.
- `max_retry_attempts` (int, optional): The maximum number of retry attempts before giving up and re-raising the exception. Defaults to 5 attempts.

#### Returns

A `retry` decorator configured with the specified parameters.

#### Behavior

- **Exponential Backoff**: The decorator uses an exponential backoff strategy for the wait times between retries. For the `i`th attempt, it waits for `2^i` seconds, with the wait time bounded between `wait_lower_bound` and `wait_upper_bound`.
- **Maximum Attempts**: The retry process stops after `max_retry_attempts` have been made without success.
- **Exception Handling**: The decorator is configured to retry on the following OpenAI exceptions:
  - `openai.APIConnectionError`
  - `openai.APIError`
  - `openai.RateLimitError`
  - `openai.APIStatusError`
  - `openai.APIResponseValidationError`
  - `openai.APITimeoutError`
- **Logging**: Before each sleep (wait before retry), a warning log is emitted using the `logging` module.

#### Usage

To use the `generate_retry_decorator`, call the function with the desired parameters to create a decorator. Then, apply this decorator to any function that makes network requests and should be retried upon encountering specific exceptions.

```python
@generate_retry_decorator(wait_lower_bound=2, wait_upper_bound=10, max_retry_attempts=3)
def my_network_request_function():
    # Function code that makes a network request
```

## Module-Level Variables

### retry_decorator

#### Description

The `retry_decorator` variable is an instance of the retry decorator created by calling `generate_retry_decorator` with the default parameters. It is ready to be used throughout the project without needing to create a new instance.

#### Usage

Apply `retry_decorator` directly to functions that require a retry mechanism with the default configuration.

```python
@retry_decorator
def another_network_request_function():
    # Function code that makes a network request
```

## Dependencies

- `tenacity`: Used for implementing the retry logic with exponential backoff and specific exception handling.
- `openai`: The OpenAI Python client library, from which specific exceptions are handled by the retry decorator.
- `logging`: Used to log warning messages before each retry attempt.

## Notes

- The module is designed to be robust against transient network issues and API-specific errors when interacting with the OpenAI API.
- The retry strategy is particularly useful in distributed systems where network reliability can be an issue.
- The module's functionality is critical for ensuring that the application can gracefully handle and recover from errors encountered during API requests.
