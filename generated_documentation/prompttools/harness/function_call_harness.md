# Function Call Harness Module

## Overview

The `function_call_harness.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It is designed to facilitate the testing and integration of functions by providing a standardized harness for function invocation. The module is expected to be used by developers to ensure that functions within the project are correctly called with the appropriate arguments and that they handle edge cases as expected.

## Usage

Currently, the module does not contain any implemented functionality, as indicated by the `TODO: Coming soon.` comment. When completed, the module would typically be used as follows:

1. **Importing the Harness**: Developers would import the `function_call_harness` module into their test suites or integration scripts.

2. **Configuring the Harness**: The harness would require configuration, likely involving specifying the function to be tested, along with any necessary arguments, expected outputs, and edge cases.

3. **Running the Harness**: Once configured, the harness could be executed, which would involve calling the specified function with the provided arguments and capturing the output.

4. **Validating Results**: The harness would then compare the actual output of the function call against the expected output to determine if the function behaves as intended.

5. **Handling Exceptions**: The harness would also be responsible for handling any exceptions thrown by the function, ensuring that they are either expected as part of the function's behavior or logged as errors.

6. **Reporting**: After execution, the harness would generate a report detailing the success or failure of the function calls, including any discrepancies between expected and actual results.

## Integration

The `function_call_harness.py` module would be integrated into the larger `documentation-generator` project as a utility for developers. It would be invoked during the development cycle, particularly in the testing phase, to ensure that all functions are well-tested and documented before deployment.

## File Structure

The file is located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/prompttools/harness/`, indicating that it is part of a larger collection of harness tools within the `prompttools` namespace. The `target_code` directory suggests that this module is specifically designed to target the code for testing purposes.

## Licensing

The file header indicates that the source code is copyrighted by Hegel AI, Inc. and that all rights are reserved. The license for the source code can be found in the `LICENSE` file located in the root directory of the source tree. Users and contributors must adhere to the terms specified in the LICENSE file when using or modifying the `function_call_harness.py` module.

## Future Development

As the module is not yet implemented, future development will involve fleshing out the functionality as described in the "Usage" section. This will include writing the code necessary to configure, execute, and report on function calls within the project. The `TODO` comment serves as a placeholder and a reminder for developers to complete the module's implementation.

## Conclusion

In its current state, the `function_call_harness.py` module serves as a template for future development. Once completed, it will be a critical tool for ensuring the reliability and correctness of functions within the `documentation-generator` project.
