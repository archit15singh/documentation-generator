# ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness Class

## Overview
The `ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness` class is a specialized experimentation harness designed for comparing multiple chat histories using a specified model. It extends the `ExperimentationHarness` class and integrates with the `OpenAIChatExperiment` class to facilitate the experimentation process.

## Attributes
- `experiment_cls_constructor`: A reference to the `OpenAIChatExperiment` class, which is used to instantiate an experiment object.
- `model_name`: A string representing the name of the model to be used in the experiment.
- `chat_histories`: A list of chat history lists, where each chat history is represented as a list of dictionaries with string keys and values. Each dictionary typically contains message data to be processed by the model.
- `model_arguments`: An optional dictionary of additional arguments that can be passed to the model. Defaults to an empty dictionary if `None` is provided.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, model_name: str, chat_histories: List[List[Dict[str, str]]], model_arguments: Optional[Dict[str, object]] = None)`
The constructor for the `ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness` class.

#### Parameters:
- `model_name`: The name of the model to be used in the experiment.
- `chat_histories`: A list of chat history lists to be fed into the model for comparison.
- `model_arguments`: Additional model arguments, if any.

#### Behavior:
- Initializes the `experiment_cls_constructor` with the `OpenAIChatExperiment` class.
- Stores the `model_name`, `chat_histories`, and `model_arguments` provided as arguments.
- Calls the superclass constructor to complete the initialization process.

### `prepare(self) -> None`
Initializes and prepares the experiment by creating an instance of the `OpenAIChatExperiment` class with the provided model name, chat histories, and model arguments.

#### Behavior:
- Instantiates the `OpenAIChatExperiment` using the `experiment_cls_constructor` with the `model_name`, `chat_histories`, and prepared model arguments.
- Calls the `prepare` method of the superclass to perform any additional preparation steps.

### `run(self)`
Executes the experiment by first ensuring that the experiment is prepared and then calling the `run` method of the superclass.

#### Behavior:
- Checks if the `experiment` attribute is set; if not, it calls the `prepare` method to initialize the experiment.
- Calls the `run` method of the superclass to execute the experiment.

## Usage
The `ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness` class is used in a project to compare the performance or responses of a model across different chat histories. It is instantiated with the required model name, chat histories, and any additional model arguments. The `prepare` method is called to set up the experiment, and the `run` method is called to execute the experiment and obtain results.

## Example
```python
# Instantiate the harness with a model name and chat histories
harness = ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness(
    model_name='gpt-3',
    chat_histories=[
        [{'user': 'Hello, how are you?'}, {'bot': 'I am fine, thank you!'}],
        [{'user': 'What's the weather like today?'}, {'bot': 'It's sunny and warm.'}]
    ]
)

# Prepare the experiment
harness.prepare()

# Run the experiment
harness.run()
```

## Notes
- The `ChatHistoryExperimentationHarness` class is part of a larger project and is expected to be used in conjunction with other components, such as the `ExperimentationHarness` and `OpenAIChatExperiment` classes.
