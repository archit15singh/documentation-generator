# MultiExperimentHarness Class

## Overview

`MultiExperimentHarness` is a class designed to facilitate the execution of experiments across multiple model providers with varying APIs. It aims to streamline the process of running experiments, evaluating results, and consolidating the data into a single table for comparison and analysis.

## Usage

The class is typically used in a project where multiple experiments need to be conducted using different machine learning models or APIs, such as comparing the performance of language models from different providers.

An example of its usage can be found in the Jupyter notebook located at `examples/notebooks/GPT4vsLlama2.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to test prompts across different models.

## Initialization

### `__init__(self, experiments: List[Experiment])`

The constructor takes a list of `Experiment` objects as an argument. Each `Experiment` object represents a specific experiment to be run using a particular model provider.

## Methods

### `prepare(self)`

This method iterates over each `Experiment` object in the `experiments` list and calls its `prepare` method. This is typically used to set up any necessary configurations or preconditions before running the experiments.

### `run(self)`

This method iterates over each `Experiment` object in the `experiments` list and calls its `run` method. This triggers the execution of the experiments, collecting results from the different model providers.

### `evaluate(self, metric_name: str, eval_fn: Callable) -> None`

This method iterates over each `Experiment` object in the `experiments` list and calls its `evaluate` method, passing a `metric_name` and an evaluation function `eval_fn`. This is used to apply a specific evaluation metric to the results of the experiments.

### `gather_feedback(self) -> None`

This method is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It is intended to be overridden or extended in subclasses to collect additional feedback from the experiments if necessary.

### `_get_argument_combos(self)`

This private method aggregates all argument combinations from each `Experiment` object's `argument_combos` attribute. It returns a list of these combinations.

### `_get_prompts(self)`

This private method aggregates all prompts from each `Experiment` object by calling their `_get_prompts` method. It returns a list of these prompts.

### `_get_results(self)`

This private method extracts and aggregates the responses from each `Experiment` object's `results` attribute by calling their `_extract_responses` method. It returns a list of these responses.

### `_get_scores(self)`

This private method aggregates the scores from each `Experiment` object's `scores` attribute. It returns a dictionary where each key is a metric name and the value is a list of scores for that metric.

### `_get_experiment_names(self)`

This private method aggregates the model names from each `Experiment` object by calling their `_get_model_names` method. It returns a list of these model names.

### `visualize(self, colname: str = None) -> None`

This method creates a visualization of the experiment results. It constructs a dictionary with keys such as "prompt", "response(s)", "latency", and "model", and populates them with data aggregated from the private methods `_get_prompts`, `_get_results`, `_get_scores`, and `_get_experiment_names`. It then creates a pandas DataFrame from this dictionary.

If a `colname` is provided, the method creates a pivot table from the DataFrame, with the `colname` values, indexed by "prompt" and with columns corresponding to "model". The aggregation function used is to take the first element.

### `rank(self, metric_name: str, is_average: bool = False) -> Dict[str, float]`

This method is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It is intended to be overridden or extended in subclasses to rank the models based on a specific metric.

## Dependencies

- `typing`: Provides type hints for function arguments and return types.
- `collections.defaultdict`: Used to create a dictionary with a default value for new keys.
- `prompttools.experiment.Experiment`: The base class for the experiments that are to be run.
- `pandas as pd`: Used for creating and manipulating data tables (DataFrames) for visualization and analysis.
