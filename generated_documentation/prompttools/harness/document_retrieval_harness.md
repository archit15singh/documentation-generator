# Document Retrieval Harness Module

## Overview

The `document_retrieval_harness.py` module is part of the `prompttools` package within the `documentation-generator` project. It is designed to facilitate the retrieval of documents in a structured manner, likely for the purpose of generating documentation or processing text data. The module is currently a placeholder, as indicated by the "TODO: Coming soon" comment, and is expected to be implemented in the future.

## License

The module is copyrighted by Hegel AI, Inc. and is subject to the terms of the license found in the LICENSE file located in the root directory of the source tree. Users and developers must consult the LICENSE file to understand the usage rights and restrictions for this module.

## Usage

As the module is not yet implemented, there is no current usage or functionality provided. Once implemented, it is expected that the module will include functions or classes that can be imported and used in other parts of the `documentation-generator` project to retrieve documents from various sources.

## Expected Functionality

When completed, the `document_retrieval_harness.py` module may provide the following functionality:

- Connect to different document storage systems (e.g., databases, file systems, cloud storage).
- Query and retrieve documents based on specific criteria or identifiers.
- Parse and preprocess documents to a standardized format for further processing.
- Cache retrieved documents for efficient access in repeated operations.
- Handle authentication and authorization if required by the document storage system.
- Provide an interface for other modules to request and receive documents seamlessly.

## Integration

The module is expected to be integrated with other components of the `documentation-generator` project, such as parsers, analyzers, and generators, to form a complete documentation generation pipeline. It will likely be invoked by higher-level scripts or modules that coordinate the overall process of documentation generation.

## Development Status

As indicated by the "TODO" comment, the module is under development and not yet functional. Developers assigned to this module will need to implement the planned features and ensure that it meets the project's requirements for document retrieval.

## Future Considerations

- The module should be designed with extensibility in mind to support new document sources as they become relevant.
- Performance considerations, such as multi-threading or asynchronous I/O, may be important for handling large volumes of documents.
- Error handling and logging will be crucial for diagnosing issues during the retrieval process.
- Unit tests and integration tests should be written to ensure the module's reliability and correctness.

## Conclusion

The `document_retrieval_harness.py` module is a planned component of the `documentation-generator` project that will be responsible for retrieving documents. It is currently not implemented, and its design and functionality will be determined as the project progresses.
