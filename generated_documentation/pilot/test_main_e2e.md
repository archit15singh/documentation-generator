# Technical Documentation for `test_main_e2e.py`

## Overview

The `test_main_e2e.py` file is a Python script that contains end-to-end (E2E) tests for a project's initialization and interaction with various AI models through different endpoints. It uses the `pytest` framework for testing, `unittest.mock` for mocking dependencies, and `dotenv` for loading environment variables.

## Dependencies

- `os`: Provides a way to use operating system dependent functionality.
- `builtins`: Access to Python's built-in namespace.
- `pytest`: A framework that makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing.
- `unittest.mock`: A library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
- `dotenv`: Reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and sets them as environment variables.

## Environment Setup

- `load_dotenv()`: Loads the environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Imports from Other Modules

- `database.database.create_tables`: Function to create database tables.
- `helpers.Project`: Class representing a project within the application.
- `test.mock_questionary.MockQuestionary`: A mock class for simulating user input.
- `.main.init`: Function to initialize the application with necessary arguments.
- `.main.get_custom_print`: Function to get a custom print function that interacts with an IPC client.

## Test Cases

### `test_init`

This test case verifies that the `init` function initializes the application with the correct arguments.

- Decorators:
  - `@pytest.mark.xfail`: Marks the test as expected to fail under certain conditions.
  - `@patch.dict(os.environ, {"DB_NAME": ":memory:"})`: Mocks the `os.environ` dictionary to use an in-memory SQLite database.

- Test Steps:
  1. Call the `init` function and store the returned arguments.
  2. Assert that the fields `app_id`, `user_id`, and `email` are not `None`.
  3. Assert that the fields `workspace` and `step` are `None`.

### `test_end_to_end`

This test case performs an end-to-end test of the application's ability to interact with various AI models through different endpoints.

- Decorators:
  - `@pytest.mark.slow`: Marks the test as slow-running.
  - `@pytest.mark.uses_tokens`: Indicates that the test uses tokens (possibly API tokens).
  - `@pytest.mark.skip`: Skips the test with the provided reason.
  - `@pytest.mark.parametrize`: Runs the test function multiple times with different arguments (endpoints and models).

- Test Steps:
  1. Use `monkeypatch.setenv` to set the `ENDPOINT` and `MODEL_NAME` environment variables.
  2. Call `create_tables` to set up the database schema.
  3. Call `init` to initialize the application and store the returned arguments.
  4. Retrieve the custom print function and IPC client instance using `get_custom_print`.
  5. Create a `Project` instance with the initialized arguments.
  6. Instantiate `MockQuestionary` with a list of responses to simulate user input.
  7. Use `patch` to replace the `questionary` module with `MockQuestionary`.
  8. Call the `start` method on the `Project` instance to simulate the project's execution.

## Usage

The `test_main_e2e.py` file is used to perform automated testing of the project's initialization process and its interaction with AI models. It ensures that the application can handle user input and communicate with different endpoints as expected. The tests are designed to be run in a continuous integration (CI) environment but can also be executed locally.

To run the tests, the `pytest` command can be used in the terminal within the project's root directory:

```bash
pytest /workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/test_main_e2e.py
```

The tests will be executed according to the configurations set by the decorators, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.
