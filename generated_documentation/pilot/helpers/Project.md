# Project Class

## Description

The `Project` class is a central component of the application that manages the overall project lifecycle, including initialization, setup, coding, and completion. It interacts with various agents (e.g., `TechLead`, `Developer`, `Architect`, `ProductOwner`, `TechnicalWriter`, `SpecWriter`) to perform different tasks such as getting project descriptions, user stories, setting up the environment, creating development plans, and handling coding tasks.

## Attributes

- `args`: A dictionary containing project arguments.
- `llm_req_num`: A counter for the number of LLM (Language Model) requests.
- `command_runs_count`: A counter for the number of commands run.
- `user_inputs_count`: A counter for the number of user inputs.
- `current_task`: An instance of `Task` representing the current task.
- `checkpoints`: A dictionary to store the last user input, command run, and development step.
- `root_path`: The root path of the project.
- `skip_until_dev_step`: A flag to skip until a certain development step.
- `skip_steps`: A flag to indicate whether to skip steps.
- `main_prompt`: The main prompt for the project.
- `files`: A list of files associated with the project.
- `continuing_project`: A flag to indicate whether the project is being continued.
- `ipc_client_instance`: An instance of the IPC client for inter-process communication.
- `finished`: A flag to indicate whether the project is finished.
- `current_step`: The current step in the project.
- `name`: The name of the project.
- `project_description`: The description of the project.
- `user_stories`: A list of user stories.
- `user_tasks`: A list of user tasks.
- `architecture`: The architecture of the project.
- `system_dependencies`: A list of system dependencies.
- `package_dependencies`: A list of package dependencies.
- `project_template`: The project template.
- `development_plan`: The development plan.
- `dot_pilot_gpt`: An instance of `DotGptPilot` for handling GPT-related tasks.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, args, *, ipc_client_instance=None)`

Constructor for the `Project` class. Initializes the project with the provided arguments and sets up the project for loading if it is being continued.

### `set_root_path(self, root_path: str)`

Sets the root path of the project and updates the `DotGptPilot` instance with the new root path.

### `setup_loading(self)`

Prepares the project for loading by clearing directories, deleting development data, and setting flags based on user input regarding file overwriting.

### `start(self)`

Starts the project by performing initial setup tasks such as getting project descriptions, user stories, architecture, setting up the environment, creating a development plan, and starting the coding process.

### `finish(self)`

Finishes the project by asking the user if they want to add any features or changes, creating feature plans, and summarizing the features.

### `get_directory_tree(self, with_descriptions=False)`

Returns the directory tree of the project, optionally including descriptions.

### `get_test_directory_tree(self)`

Returns the directory tree of the tests.

### `get_files_from_db_by_step_id(self, step_id)`

Retrieves all coded files associated with a specific `step_id`.

### `get_all_coded_files(self)`

Retrieves all coded files in the project.

### `get_files(self, files)`

Retrieves file contents for a list of file paths.

### `find_input_required_lines(self, file_content)`

Finds lines in the file content that contain the text 'INPUT_REQUIRED'.

### `save_file(self, data)`

Saves a file with the provided data, updating the database and handling user input if required.

### `get_full_file_path(self, file_path: str, file_name: str) -> Tuple[str, str]`

Combines file path and name into a full file path, handling various edge cases.

### `save_files_snapshot(self, development_step_id)`

Saves a snapshot of all files at a given development step.

### `restore_files(self, development_step_id)`

Restores files from a snapshot associated with a given development step.

### `delete_all_steps_except_current_branch(self)`

Deletes all unconnected steps from the current branch in the database.

### `ask_for_human_intervention(self, message, description=None, cbs={}, convo=None, is_root_task=False, add_loop_button=False)`

Asks for human intervention with a provided message and handles callbacks based on user input.

### `log(self, text, message_type)`

Logs a message with the specified type, using IPC if available.

### `check_ipc(self)`

Checks if there is an open IPC connection.

### `finish_loading(self, do_cleanup=True)`

Finishes the loading process of the project, optionally performing cleanup.

### `cleanup_list(self, list_name, target_id)`

Cleans up a list by removing elements up to a target ID.

### `remove_debugging_logs_from_all_files(self)`

Removes debugging logs from all files in the project.

## Usage

The `Project` class is instantiated with project arguments and an optional IPC client instance. It manages the project lifecycle through its methods, interacting with various agents and utilities to perform tasks such as setting up the environment, coding, and handling project completion. It also handles file operations, database interactions, and IPC communication as needed throughout the project.
