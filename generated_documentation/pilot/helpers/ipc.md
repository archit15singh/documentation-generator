# ipc.py Module Documentation

## Overview

The `ipc.py` module provides an `IPCClient` class that facilitates inter-process communication (IPC) using TCP sockets. It is designed to connect to an external process, send and receive JSON-formatted messages, and handle requests from the external process.

## Dependencies

- `socket`: A module to provide access to the BSD socket interface.
- `json`: A module to work with JSON data.
- `time`: A module providing various time-related functions (not used in the current implementation).
- `utils.utils`: A custom module that contains the `json_serial` function used for JSON serialization.

## IPCClient Class

### Attributes

- `ready`: A boolean flag indicating whether the client is ready for communication.
- `client`: A `socket.socket` instance representing the TCP client socket.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self, port)`
The constructor initializes the IPC client.

- **Parameters:**
  - `port`: The port number on which to connect to the external process.

- **Behavior:**
  - Creates a TCP socket using `socket.AF_INET` and `socket.SOCK_STREAM`.
  - Attempts to connect to the external process running on `localhost` at the specified `port`.
  - If the connection is successful, it stores the socket in the `client` attribute and sets `ready` to `True`.
  - If the connection fails with a `ConnectionRefusedError`, it sets `client` to `None` and prints an error message.

#### `handle_request(self, message_content)`
A method to handle incoming requests from the external process.

- **Parameters:**
  - `message_content`: The content of the message received from the external process.

- **Returns:**
  - The same `message_content` received, effectively echoing back the content.

- **Behavior:**
  - Prints the received request for demonstration purposes.

#### `listen(self)`
A method to listen for messages from the external process.

- **Behavior:**
  - Checks if the client is connected (`self.client` is not `None`).
  - If not connected, prints an error message and returns.
  - If connected, enters an infinite loop to continuously receive data from the socket.
  - Receives data from the socket and attempts to decode it as JSON.
  - If the message type is 'response', it returns the message content.
  - (Note: The method currently does not handle other message types or close the socket.)

#### `send(self, data)`
A method to send data to the external process.

- **Parameters:**
  - `data`: The data to be sent, which can be any JSON-serializable object.

- **Behavior:**
  - Serializes the `data` into a JSON string using `json.dumps` and the `json_serial` function for custom serialization.
  - Calculates the length of the serialized data.
  - If the client is connected, sends the length of the data as a 4-byte big-endian integer, followed by the actual serialized data encoded in 'utf-8'.

## Usage

The `IPCClient` class is used to establish a connection to an external process for IPC. It can send and receive JSON messages, which allows for structured data exchange between processes. The class provides basic functionality to demonstrate IPC mechanisms, and it can be extended or modified to fit specific project requirements.

Example usage:
```python
# Create an IPC client instance and connect to the external process on port 5000
ipc_client = IPCClient(port=5000)

# Send a message to the external process
ipc_client.send({'type': 'request', 'content': 'Hello, external process!'})

# Listen for a response from the external process
response = ipc_client.listen()
print(f"Response from external process: {response}")
```

Note: The `ipc.py` module and the `IPCClient` class are designed for demonstration purposes and may require additional error handling, message validation, and functionality to be production-ready.
