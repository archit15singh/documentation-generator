# AgentConvo Class

## Overview
The `AgentConvo` class represents a conversation with an agent within a project. It is responsible for managing the flow of messages between the user, the system, and the agent, as well as handling the interaction with the agent's API.

## Attributes
- `messages`: A list of dictionaries representing the conversation history, where each dictionary contains a `role` key (with values 'system', 'user', or 'assistant') and a `content` key.
- `branches`: A dictionary to store different conversation branches identified by unique names.
- `log_to_user`: A boolean indicating whether messages should be logged to the user.
- `agent`: An instance of the agent participating in the conversation.
- `high_level_step`: The current high-level step of the project.
- `temperature`: A float representing the creativity of the agent's responses.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, agent, temperature: float = 0.7)`
Constructor for the `AgentConvo` class.
- Initializes the conversation with a system message based on the agent's role and project arguments.
- Logs the system message to the logger.

### `send_message(self, prompt_path=None, prompt_data=None, function_calls: FunctionCallSet = None, should_log_message=True)`
Sends a message in the conversation and handles the agent's response.
- Constructs and adds a message from the provided prompt.
- Replaces file content in the message if necessary.
- Calls the agent API to get a response.
- Handles token limit errors and API errors.
- Parses the agent's response and formats it for inclusion in the conversation history.
- Logs the assistant's prompt to the logger.
- Appends the formatted response to the conversation history.
- Optionally logs the message content to the user.

### `format_message_content(self, response, function_calls)`
Formats the content of a message based on the response and any function calls.
- If the response is a string, it returns the response directly.
- If the response is not a string, it serializes the response to JSON.

### `continuous_conversation(self, prompt_path, prompt_data, function_calls=None)`
Conducts a continuous conversation with the agent until a specific end response is received.
- Logs messages to the user are temporarily disabled.
- Continues to send and receive messages until the `END_RESPONSE` is encountered.
- Allows the user to add additional input at each step.
- Logs user messages to the logger.
- Re-enables logging messages to the user at the end of the conversation.

### `save_branch(self, branch_name=None)`
Saves the current state of the conversation to a branch.
- Generates a unique branch name if none is provided.
- Copies the current messages to the branches dictionary under the branch name.

### `load_branch(self, branch_name, reload_files=True)`
Loads a previously saved branch of the conversation.
- Replaces the current messages with the messages from the specified branch.
- Optionally replaces file content in the messages.

### `replace_files(self)`
Replaces file content in user messages with the latest content from the project.

### `replace_files_in_one_message(self, files, message)`
Replaces file content in a single message with the latest content from the project.

### `escape_specials(s)`
Escapes special characters in a string to prevent issues with formatting or interpretation.

### `convo_length(self)`
Returns the number of messages in the conversation, excluding system messages.

### `log_message(self, content)`
Logs a message to the console and the logger, with additional context based on the project's current step.

### `to_context_prompt(self)`
Generates a context prompt for the conversation based on the project's directory tree and running processes.

### `to_playground(self)`
Copies the conversation to the clipboard in a format suitable for debugging in the OpenAI Playground.

### `remove_last_x_messages(self, x)`
Removes the last `x` messages from the conversation history.

### `construct_and_add_message_from_prompt(self, prompt_path, prompt_data)`
Constructs a message from a prompt and adds it to the conversation history.

## Usage
The `AgentConvo` class is used within a project to manage interactions with an agent. It is responsible for sending messages, handling responses, managing conversation branches, and logging the conversation for the user and the system. It interacts with various utilities and helpers, such as `style`, `database`, `exceptions`, `function_calling`, `llm_connection`, `utils`, `logger`, `prompts`, and `cli`, to perform its functions.
