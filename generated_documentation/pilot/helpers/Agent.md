# Agent Module

## Overview

The `Agent` module is located in the `pilot/helpers` directory of the `documentation-generator` project. This module defines a single class, `Agent`, which is used to represent an entity with a specific role within a project.

## Class: Agent

### Description

The `Agent` class encapsulates the concept of an agent with a designated role in a project. It is a simple class with a constructor that initializes the agent's role and the project they are associated with.

### Attributes

- `role`: A string representing the role of the agent within the project.
- `project`: A string or object representing the project to which the agent is assigned.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self, role, project)`

The constructor method for the `Agent` class.

##### Parameters

- `role`: A string indicating the role of the agent. This parameter is required and determines the responsibilities or permissions the agent has within the project.
- `project`: A string or object that represents the project the agent is involved in. This parameter is required and links the agent to a specific project.

##### Returns

None. The constructor initializes the `Agent` instance with the provided `role` and `project`.

### Usage

An instance of the `Agent` class is created by passing the required parameters `role` and `project` to the constructor. Once instantiated, the `Agent` object can be used in the project to represent a participant with a specific role, such as a developer, tester, or project manager.

#### Example

```python
from pilot.helpers.Agent import Agent

# Create an Agent instance with the role of 'Developer' for the 'DocumentationGenerator' project
developer_agent = Agent(role='Developer', project='DocumentationGenerator')

# The developer_agent can now be used within the project to represent a developer's actions or permissions.
```

### Integration

The `Agent` class is designed to be integrated into larger systems within the `documentation-generator` project. It can be used to assign roles to users, manage permissions, or track participation in various project activities. The class may be extended or used as a base for more complex agent representations, depending on the project's requirements.
