# TestDeveloper Class

## Overview

The `TestDeveloper` class is a test suite for the `Developer` class, which is part of a project that seems to involve automating development tasks using AI or machine learning models. The tests are written using the `pytest` framework and include mocking of dependencies and external services.

## Setup Method

### `setup_method(self)`

This method is called before each test method to set up the necessary environment for the tests. It performs the following steps:

1. Overrides the built-in `print` function with a custom print function obtained from `get_custom_print`.
2. Initializes a new project instance using `create_project`.
3. Sets the `app_id`, `name`, and `root_path` of the project.
4. Initializes an empty list for `technologies`.
5. Sets the `current_step` of the project to `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_STEP`.
6. Creates a `Developer` instance with the initialized project.

## Test Methods

### `test_install_technology(self, mock_execute_command, mock_completion, mock_save)`

This test checks if the `Developer` instance can correctly install a technology by:

1. Creating an `AgentConvo` instance for the developer.
2. Calling `check_system_dependency` with 'python' as the argument.
3. Asserting that the response is 'DONE'.
4. Verifying that `execute_command` was called with the correct parameters.

### `test_implement_task(self, mock_completion, mock_save)`

This test verifies that the `Developer` instance can implement a task by:

1. Creating a project with a development plan.
2. Creating a `Developer` instance and mocking the `execute_task` method.
3. Calling `implement_task` with a task description.
4. Asserting that `execute_task` was called with the correct steps.

### `test_implement_task_reject_with_user_input(self, mock_completion, mock_save)`

This test checks the behavior of the `Developer` instance when a task is rejected and user input is required by:

1. Creating a project with a development plan.
2. Creating a `Developer` instance and mocking the `execute_task` method with a side effect.
3. Calling `implement_task` with a task description.
4. Asserting that the conversation is updated with user input and `execute_task` is called again.

### `test_code_changes_command_test(self, mock_save, mock_chat_completion, mock_execute_command)`

This test ensures that the `Developer` instance can handle a command test by:

1. Creating an `AgentConvo` instance.
2. Calling `test_code_changes` with the conversation.
3. Asserting that the result indicates success.

### `test_code_changes_manual_test_continue(self, mock_save, mock_chat_completion, mock_ask_user)`

This test verifies that the `Developer` instance can handle a manual test and continue by:

1. Creating an `AgentConvo` instance.
2. Calling `test_code_changes` with the conversation.
3. Asserting that the result indicates success.

### `test_code_changes_manual_test_no(self, mock_get_saved_user_input, mock_chat_completion, mock_save)`

This test checks the behavior of the `Developer` instance when a manual test is not successful by:

1. Creating an `AgentConvo` instance.
2. Mocking the conversation with a series of responses.
3. Calling `test_code_changes` with the conversation.
4. Asserting that the result indicates success and includes user input.

### `test_test_code_changes_invalid_json(self, mock_requests_post, mock_save, mock_execute, monkeypatch)`

This test ensures that the `Developer` instance can handle invalid JSON responses by:

1. Creating an `AgentConvo` instance.
2. Mocking the `requests.post` method to return a series of responses.
3. Setting an environment variable for the OpenAI API key.
4. Calling `test_code_changes` with the conversation.
5. Asserting that the result indicates success and that no actual requests were made.

## Mocks and Patches

The test suite uses the `unittest.mock.patch` decorator to mock dependencies and external services. This includes mocking the `requests` library, the `questionary` utility, and various methods from the `helpers.AgentConvo`, `helpers.cli`, and `utils.llm_connection` modules.

## Usage

The `TestDeveloper` class is used to run automated tests on the `Developer` class to ensure that it behaves as expected when performing development tasks. The tests are designed to cover various scenarios, including system dependency checks, task implementation, and code change testing with both command and manual tests.

To run the tests, a test runner that supports `pytest` is required. The tests can be executed as part of a continuous integration pipeline or manually by a developer to verify changes to the `Developer` class or its dependencies.
