# `agents` Package

The `agents` package within the `pilot/helpers` directory is designed to encapsulate different roles involved in a software development process. It provides a modular approach to represent various responsibilities and actions that can be performed by different agents in the context of software project management and execution.

## Modules and Classes

The package consists of three modules, each representing a specific role in the software development lifecycle:

### `Architect` Module

- **Class:** `Architect`
  - **Description:** This class represents the role of a software architect in the project. An architect is responsible for designing the overall structure of the system, ensuring that it meets the necessary requirements and is scalable, maintainable, and secure.
  - **Usage:** An instance of the `Architect` class can be used to invoke methods related to the architectural design steps of a project, such as defining the system's architecture, selecting appropriate design patterns, and setting up high-level structures.

- **Constant:** `ARCHITECTURE_STEP`
  - **Description:** This constant defines a specific step in the project lifecycle that corresponds to the architectural design phase. It is used to identify and track the progress of tasks related to the architecture of the system.
  - **Usage:** The `ARCHITECTURE_STEP` constant can be used as a reference or a marker within the project management tools to indicate that a particular task or set of tasks is associated with the architectural phase of the project.

### `Developer` Module

- **Class:** `Developer`
  - **Description:** This class embodies the role of a developer, who is primarily responsible for writing code, implementing features, and fixing bugs in the software project.
  - **Usage:** An instance of the `Developer` class is utilized to carry out development-related activities such as coding new features, refactoring existing code, and debugging issues. The class may provide methods for interacting with version control systems, managing pull requests, and performing code reviews.

- **Constant:** `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_STEP`
  - **Description:** This constant signifies the step in the project lifecycle where the development environment is set up. This includes configuring the necessary tools, frameworks, and dependencies required for the development process.
  - **Usage:** The `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_STEP` constant is used to denote tasks that involve setting up or modifying the development environment. It can be referenced in documentation, scripts, or automation tools that are part of the environment setup process.

### `TechLead` Module

- **Class:** `TechLead`
  - **Description:** The `TechLead` class represents the technical leadership role within the project. A tech lead guides the development team, makes key technical decisions, and ensures that the team adheres to best practices and project standards.
  - **Usage:** An instance of the `TechLead` class is used for activities that require technical oversight and leadership, such as making architectural decisions, conducting code reviews, and mentoring developers. The tech lead may also be responsible for interfacing with other stakeholders, such as product managers and designers, to align technical objectives with business goals.

## Integration in the Project

The `agents` package is integrated into the project to provide a clear separation of concerns and to facilitate the assignment of tasks based on the roles defined by the classes. Each class within the package can be instantiated and used to perform role-specific operations throughout the software development process.

For example, during the initial phases of the project, an `Architect` instance may be used to design the system architecture, while `Developer` instances are later used to implement the designed architecture. The `TechLead` plays a continuous role in overseeing the development process, ensuring that the implementation aligns with the architectural vision and meets the project's technical standards.

The constants `ARCHITECTURE_STEP` and `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_STEP` serve as checkpoints or milestones within the project management workflow, allowing for better tracking and organization of tasks related to architecture and environment setup, respectively.

By using the `agents` package, the project can maintain a structured approach to software development, with clear roles and responsibilities that contribute to a more efficient and collaborative environment.
