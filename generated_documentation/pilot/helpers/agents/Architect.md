# Architect Class

## Overview
The `Architect` class is a subclass of `Agent` and is responsible for determining the architecture of a software project. It interacts with the user to gather information about the project requirements and suggests an appropriate architecture, system dependencies, package dependencies, and project templates.

## Attributes
- `convo_architecture`: An instance of `AgentConvo` used to handle the conversation with the user regarding the project architecture.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, project)`
Constructor for the `Architect` class.
- Initializes the parent `Agent` class with the name 'architect' and the provided project.
- Initializes `convo_architecture` to `None`.

### `get_architecture(self)`
Main method to determine the project architecture.
- Outputs the current project stage as 'architecture' in JSON format.
- Sets the current step of the project to `ARCHITECTURE_STEP`.
- Checks if the architecture step has already been completed for the given `app_id` by querying the database. If so, it retrieves the data and sets the project attributes accordingly without asking the user again.
- If the step has not been completed, it prints a message indicating the planning of the project architecture and logs this information.
- Initializes `convo_architecture` as an instance of `AgentConvo` with the current `Architect` instance.
- Sends a message to the `convo_architecture` with the prompt 'architecture/technologies.prompt' and the necessary context, including project name, description, user stories, tasks, operating system, app type, and available project templates.
- Receives the response from the language model and sets the project's architecture, system dependencies, package dependencies, and project template based on the response.
- Checks if any of the system dependencies or package dependencies are in the warning lists (`WARN_SYSTEM_DEPS` and `WARN_FRAMEWORKS`). If so, it prints a warning message and prompts the user to proceed or modify the project description.
- Logs the final architecture decision.
- Saves the progress of the architecture step in the database with the conversation messages, architecture response, and application data.

## Constants
- `ARCHITECTURE_STEP`: A string constant representing the architecture step in the project workflow.
- `WARN_SYSTEM_DEPS`: A list of system dependencies that are not officially supported by GPT Pilot.
- `WARN_FRAMEWORKS`: A list of frontend frameworks that may cause compatibility issues with GPT Pilot.
- `WARN_FRAMEWORKS_URL`: A URL to the GPT Pilot wiki page with more information on using frontend frameworks.

## Usage
The `Architect` class is used in the project workflow to determine the architecture of the project. It is instantiated with a project object and then the `get_architecture` method is called to perform the architecture planning process. This involves interacting with the user, querying the database for existing progress, and saving the new progress after determining the architecture.

## Dependencies
- `utils.utils`: Contains utility functions like `step_already_finished`, `should_execute_step`, and `generate_app_data`.
- `helpers.Agent`: The parent class for `Architect`.
- `json`: Used to output JSON formatted data.
- `utils.style`: Contains functions for styling console output, such as `color_green_bold` and `color_yellow_bold`.
- `const.function_calls`: Contains constants for function calls, including `ARCHITECTURE`.
- `platform`: Used to get the current operating system information.
- `database.database`: Contains functions for database operations like `save_progress` and `get_progress_steps`.
- `logger.logger`: Provides logging functionality.
- `helpers.AgentConvo`: Used to handle conversations with the user.
- `prompts.prompts`: Contains functions for prompting the user.
- `templates`: Contains project templates.
