# TestTechLead Class

## Overview

The `TestTechLead` class is a test suite for the `TechLead` class, which is part of a project's development planning process. The test suite is designed to validate the functionality of creating a development plan by a technical lead.

## Dependencies

- `builtins`: Used to override the built-in `print` function with a custom one.
- `os`: Provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
- `pytest`: A framework that makes it easy to write simple tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing.
- `unittest.mock.patch`: Used for patching module and class-level attributes within the test scope.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `os.environ`.
- `main.get_custom_print`: Retrieves a custom print function.
- `helpers.agents.TechLead`: Contains the `TechLead` class and the `DEVELOPMENT_PLANNING_STEP` constant.
- `helpers.Project`: Contains the `Project` class.
- `test.test_utils.assert_non_empty_string`: Utility function to assert that a string is not empty.
- `test.mock_questionary.MockQuestionary`: A mock implementation of the `questionary` module for testing user input.

## Setup Method

The `setup_method` is executed before each test method in the class. It performs the following steps:

1. Overrides the built-in `print` function with a custom one using `get_custom_print`.
2. Initializes a `Project` instance with predefined attributes such as `app_id`, `name`, `app_type`, `architecture`, and `user_stories`.
3. Sets the root path of the project to a directory within the test workspace.
4. Assigns an empty list to the project's `technologies`.
5. Defines a `project_description` with details about the web-based chat application being developed.
6. Populates `user_stories` with a list of user stories related to the chat application.
7. Sets the `architecture` of the project to a list of technologies.
8. Sets the `current_step` of the project to `DEVELOPMENT_PLANNING_STEP`.

## Test: test_create_development_plan

The `test_create_development_plan` method is a test case that verifies the creation of a development plan by a technical lead. It uses the `pytest.mark.uses_tokens` decorator to indicate that the test uses tokens. The test method is decorated with three `patch` decorators to mock the `get_saved_development_step`, `save_progress`, and `get_progress_steps` methods.

### Steps

1. Initializes a `TechLead` instance with the project set up in the `setup_method`.
2. Creates a `MockQuestionary` instance with predefined responses.
3. Patches the `questionary` module with the `MockQuestionary` instance.
4. Calls the `create_development_plan` method of the `TechLead` instance.
5. Asserts that the `development_plan` returned is not `None`.
6. Asserts that the first item in the `development_plan` has a non-empty `description`.
7. Asserts that the first item in the `development_plan` has a non-empty `user_review_goal`.

## Usage

The `TestTechLead` class is used to ensure that the `TechLead` class correctly implements the functionality required to create a development plan. It is part of the automated test suite and is executed during the testing phase of the project to catch regressions or bugs in the development planning process.
