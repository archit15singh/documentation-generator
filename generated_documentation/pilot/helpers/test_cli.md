# `test_cli.py` Module

This module contains unit tests for the `cli` helper functions used within a project. The tests are designed to ensure that the command-line interface (CLI) helper functions behave as expected under various conditions. The module uses the `pytest` framework for testing and the `unittest.mock` library to mock dependencies.

## Imports

- `platform`: Used to retrieve platform-specific details.
- `unittest.mock`: Provides the `patch`, `MagicMock`, and `call` classes for mocking objects during tests.
- `pytest`: A framework for writing small to complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

## Functions from `helpers.cli` Tested

- `execute_command`: Executes a given command within the context of a project, with an optional timeout and force parameter.
- `terminate_process`: Terminates a process based on its process ID (PID).
- `run_command_until_success`: Runs a command repeatedly until it succeeds or a condition is met.

## Test Cases

### `test_terminate_process_not_running`

This test ensures that if a process is not running, neither `subprocess.run` nor `os.killpg` are called.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.os`: Mocks the operating system interface.
  - `helpers.cli.subprocess`: Mocks the subprocess module for running commands.

### `test_execute_command_timeout_exit_code`

Tests the `execute_command` function to ensure it handles a timeout correctly and terminates the process.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.MIN_COMMAND_RUN_TIME`: Mocks the minimum command run time.
  - `helpers.cli.run_command`: Mocks the function that runs the command.
  - `helpers.cli.terminate_process`: Mocks the function that terminates the process.

### `test_execute_command_enter`

Verifies that the `execute_command` function returns the correct output when a command is executed successfully.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.ask_user`: Mocks the function that asks for user input.
  - `helpers.cli.run_command`: Mocks the function that runs the command.
  - `helpers.cli.terminate_process`: Mocks the function that terminates the process.

### `test_execute_command_yes`

Checks that the `execute_command` function behaves correctly when the user input is 'yes'.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.ask_user`: Mocks the function that asks for user input.
  - `helpers.cli.run_command`: Mocks the function that runs the command.
  - `helpers.cli.terminate_process`: Mocks the function that terminates the process.

### `test_execute_command_rejected_with_no`

Ensures that the `execute_command` function returns the appropriate response when the user input is 'no'.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.ask_user`: Mocks the function that asks for user input.

### `test_execute_command_rejected_with_message`

Confirms that the `execute_command` function handles a user rejection with a custom message correctly.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.ask_user`: Mocks the function that asks for user input.

### `test_run_command_until_success`

Tests the `run_command_until_success` function to ensure it returns success when the command executes without errors.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

### `test_run_command_until_success_app`

Verifies that the `run_command_until_success` function behaves correctly when running an application command.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

### `test_run_command_until_success_error`

Checks that the `run_command_until_success` function handles command errors correctly and does not return success.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

### `test_run_command_until_success_timed_out`

Ensures that the `run_command_until_success` function correctly handles a timeout scenario.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

### `test_run_command_until_success_no`

Confirms that the `run_command_until_success` function returns success when the user input is 'no'.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

### `test_run_command_until_success_rejected`

Tests that the `run_command_until_success` function handles a user rejection with a custom message correctly.

- Mocks:
  - `helpers.cli.execute_command`: Mocks the `execute_command` function.

## Usage

The tests in this module are executed as part of the project's test suite to validate the behavior of the CLI helper functions. They are typically run using a test runner that is compatible with the `pytest` framework, such as running `pytest` from the command line.

## Notes

- The tests use the `patch` decorator to replace the real objects with mocks, allowing the tests to isolate the function being tested and control its environment.
- The `MagicMock` class is used to create mock objects that can be configured to return specific values when called.
- The `call` class is used to track calls to mock objects and assert that they were called with the expected arguments.
