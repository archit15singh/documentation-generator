# `db_init.py` Module

## Overview

The `db_init.py` module is a Python script responsible for initializing the database by dropping existing tables and creating new ones. It is typically used to reset the database to a clean state before running the application or during the development process when schema changes are made.

## Dependencies

- `dotenv`: A Python module that reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and sets them as environment variables.
- `database.database`: A custom module that presumably contains the `create_tables` and `drop_tables` functions.

## Usage

### Environment Variables

Before any database operations are performed, the script loads environment variables using `load_dotenv()` from the `dotenv` package. This function looks for a `.env` file in the same directory as the script or any parent directories and loads the variables found there. These variables typically include database connection parameters such as the database name, user, password, host, and port.

### Dropping Tables

The script calls `drop_tables()` from the `database.database` module. This function is expected to connect to the configured database and drop all existing tables. This operation clears out all data and schema from the current database, making it an irreversible action that should be used with caution.

### Creating Tables

After dropping the tables, the script calls `create_tables()` from the `database.database` module. This function is responsible for creating a fresh set of tables according to the defined schema. It sets up the database structure required for the application to function correctly.

## Execution

The script is executed directly, typically from the command line or as part of a larger setup or deployment script. When run, it performs the following steps in order:

1. Load environment variables from the `.env` file using `load_dotenv()`.
2. Drop all existing tables in the database by calling `drop_tables()`.
3. Create new tables in the database by calling `create_tables()`.

## Considerations

- The script should be used with caution, especially in production environments, as it will result in the loss of all existing data in the database.
- Proper database backups should be taken before executing this script if there is a need to preserve the current data.
- The `.env` file should be secured and not checked into version control if it contains sensitive information like database credentials.
- The `database.database` module should handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages if the database operations fail.
- The script assumes that the `database.database` module is correctly implemented and that the functions `drop_tables()` and `create_tables()` exist and work as intended.
