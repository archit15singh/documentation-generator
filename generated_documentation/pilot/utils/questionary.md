# `questionary.py` Module Documentation

## Overview

The `questionary.py` module is part of the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/utils/` directory and is responsible for handling user interactions through the command line interface (CLI). It utilizes the `questionary` library to prompt users for input and process their responses. The module also includes functions to sanitize input, manage input/output styles, and interact with a database to save user input.

## Functions

### `remove_ansi_codes(s: str) -> str`

Removes ANSI escape codes from a string.

#### Parameters:
- `s`: A string that may contain ANSI escape codes.

#### Returns:
- A string with all ANSI escape codes removed.

#### Usage:
This function is used to clean up strings that may contain ANSI codes, which are not compatible with the `questionary` library.

### `styled_select(*args, **kwargs)`

Presents a styled selection list to the user and returns their choice.

#### Parameters:
- `*args`: Positional arguments passed to `questionary.select`.
- `**kwargs`: Keyword arguments passed to `questionary.select`.

#### Returns:
- The selected option from the user.

#### Usage:
This function is used to prompt the user with a list of options in a styled format. The style is retrieved from `style_config.get_style()`.

### `styled_text(project, question, ignore_user_input_count=False, style=None, hint=None)`

Asks the user a question and returns the answer.

#### Parameters:
- `project`: The project context object.
- `question`: The question to be asked to the user.
- `ignore_user_input_count`: A boolean indicating whether to increment the user input count.
- `style`: The style configuration to be used for the prompt.
- `hint`: An optional hint to provide context for the question.

#### Returns:
- The user's response to the question.

#### Usage:
This function is used to ask the user a question and capture their input. It also handles IPC (Inter-Process Communication) if necessary and saves the user input to the database using `save_user_input`. It is recommended to use `ask_user()` instead of this function unless `project.finish_loading()` should not be triggered.

### `get_user_feedback()`

Prompts the user for feedback on the GPT Pilot.

#### Returns:
- The user's feedback as a string.

#### Usage:
This function is used at the end of a session to collect feedback from the user about their experience with the GPT Pilot.

### `ask_user_to_store_init_prompt()`

Asks the user for permission to store their initial app prompt.

#### Returns:
- The user's response as a string.

#### Usage:
This function is used to request consent from the user to store the initial prompt they provided for the application.

### `flush_input()`

Flushes the input buffer to discard any pending input.

#### Usage:
This function is used to clear the input buffer before prompting the user for new input. It handles different implementations for Windows and Unix-like systems.

## Dependencies

- `platform`: Used to determine the operating system for flushing the input buffer.
- `questionary`: A library for creating interactive CLI prompts.
- `re`: Used to compile regular expressions for removing ANSI codes.
- `sys`: Used to access the input buffer for flushing.
- `database.database`: Contains the `save_user_input` function to save user responses to the database.
- `utils.style`: Contains the `style_config` object to apply styling to CLI prompts.

## Notes

- The module contains a `TODO` comment indicating that saving and loading of user input needs to be added to the `styled_select` function.
- The `unsafe_ask` method is used instead of `ask` to bypass any exceptions that might be raised during user input.
- The `flush_input` function may not work on all systems due to differences in terminal behavior and the availability of required modules.
