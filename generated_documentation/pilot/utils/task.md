# Task Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Task` class is a data structure designed to store and manage information about a specific task within a project. It is primarily used to trace and handle large loops in the code by sending telemetry data for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Usage

### Importing the Task Class

```python
from utils.task import Task
```

### Creating a New Task Instance

```python
task = Task()
```

### Setting Task Data

```python
task.set('task_description', 'test')
```

### Incrementing Task Data

```python
task.inc('steps')
```

### Starting a New Task

```python
task.start_new_task('test', 1)
```

### Adding a Debugging Task

```python
task.add_debugging_task(1, {'command': 'test'}, 'This is not working', 'Command is not working')
```

### Clearing Task Data

```python
task.clear()
```

### Sending Task Data

```python
task.send()
```

## Methods

### `__init__(self)`

Constructor that initializes the task with default data.

- `initial_data`: A dictionary containing the default structure of the task data.
- `data`: A copy of `initial_data` that will be manipulated.
- `ping_extension`: A boolean flag to control the pinging of the extension.

### `set(self, key: str, value: any)`

Sets a value in the task data.

- `key`: The key in the task data to set.
- `value`: The value to assign to the key.

### `inc(self, key: str, value: int = 1)`

Increments a value in the task data.

- `key`: The key in the task data to increment.
- `value`: The amount by which to increment the key's value.

If the incremented key is 'steps' and reaches the `LOOP_THRESHOLD + 1`, the task data is sent automatically.

### `start_new_task(self, task_description: str, i: int)`

Starts a new task by sending the current task data, clearing it, and setting up a new task with a description and number.

- `task_description`: A string describing the new task.
- `i`: An integer representing the task number.

A unique loop ID is generated using `uuid4()`.

### `add_debugging_task(self, recursion_layer: int = None, command: dict = None, user_input: str = None, issue_description: str = None)`

Adds a debugging task to the task data structure.

- `recursion_layer`: The recursion layer at which the debugging task is added.
- `command`: A dictionary representing the command to debug.
- `user_input`: A string of user input related to the debugging task.
- `issue_description`: A string describing the issue encountered.

### `add_user_input_to_debugging_task(self, user_input: str)`

Adds user input to the last debugging task in the list.

- `user_input`: A string of user input to add.

### `clear(self)`

Clears all the task data by resetting `data` to a copy of `initial_data`.

### `send(self, name: str = 'loop-start', force: bool = False)`

Sends the task data to telemetry.

- `name`: A string representing the name of the event.
- `force`: A boolean to force the sending of task data to telemetry regardless of the `steps` count.

If `steps` exceed `LOOP_THRESHOLD` or `force` is `True`, the task data is combined with telemetry data and sent using `trace_code_event`. If `ping_extension` is `True` and `force` is `False`, a JSON message is printed to trigger the extension.

### `exit(self)`

Sends the task data to telemetry with the event name 'loop-end' and exits the process.

## Constants

- `LOOP_THRESHOLD`: An integer value imported from `const.telemetry` that defines the threshold for automatic task data sending.

## Dependencies

- `json`: Used for serializing data into a JSON formatted string.
- `uuid4`: Used for generating unique identifiers.
- `utils.telemetry`: Provides access to telemetry data and functionality.
- `utils.exit.trace_code_event`: Used to send telemetry data with a specific event name.
- `const.telemetry.LOOP_THRESHOLD`: Provides the threshold value for loop detection.

## Notes

- The `Task` class is designed to work in conjunction with a telemetry system and an extension that can be pinged for additional actions.
- The `TODO` comment suggests a future consideration for the behavior of pinging the extension multiple times.
