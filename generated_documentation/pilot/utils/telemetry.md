# Telemetry Module

## Overview

The `telemetry.py` module provides a class `Telemetry` for collecting and sending anonymous telemetry data from the GPT-Pilot application. This data helps in understanding how the application is used and in identifying areas for improvement.

## Class: Telemetry

### Description

The `Telemetry` class is responsible for managing telemetry data, including collection, storage, and transmission to a remote server. It is designed as a singleton, meaning only one instance should exist during the application's lifecycle.

### Usage

To use the `Telemetry` class, import the `telemetry` global variable from the module:

```python
from utils.telemetry import telemetry
```

### Methods

#### `__init__(self)`

Constructor that initializes the telemetry system. It checks the application settings to determine if telemetry is enabled and sets up the telemetry ID and endpoint accordingly.

#### `clear_data(self)`

Resets telemetry data to default values, including system information and application-specific metrics.

#### `clear_counters(self)`

Resets telemetry counters while preserving base data.

#### `setup(self)`

Sets up a new unique telemetry ID and default phone-home endpoint. This method should be called only once during the initial setup of GPT-Pilot.

#### `set(self, name: str, value: Any)`

Sets a telemetry data field to a specified value. Only known data fields can be set.

#### `inc(self, name: str, value: int = 1)`

Increments a telemetry data field by a specified value. Only known data fields can be incremented.

#### `start(self)`

Records the start time of the application creation process.

#### `stop(self)`

Records the end time of the application creation process and calculates the elapsed time.

#### `record_crash(self, exception: Exception, end_result: str = "failure")`

Records crash diagnostics, including the stack trace, exception details, and the last few frames of the stack trace.

#### `record_llm_request(self, tokens: int, elapsed_time: int, is_error: bool)`

Records details of a language model (LLM) request, including the number of tokens, elapsed time, and whether the request resulted in an error.

#### `calculate_statistics(self)`

Calculates statistics for large and slow requests based on predefined thresholds.

#### `send(self, event: str = "pilot-telemetry")`

Sends the collected telemetry data to the configured endpoint and then clears the counters.

### Attributes

- `DEFAULT_ENDPOINT`: The default URL to which telemetry data is sent.
- `MAX_CRASH_FRAMES`: The maximum number of stack frames to record in crash diagnostics.
- `enabled`: A boolean indicating if telemetry is enabled.
- `telemetry_id`: A unique identifier for the telemetry session.
- `endpoint`: The URL to which telemetry data is sent.
- `data`: A dictionary containing telemetry data.
- `start_time`: The start time of the application creation process.
- `end_time`: The end time of the application creation process.
- `large_requests`: A list of large LLM requests.
- `slow_requests`: A list of slow LLM requests.

### Global Variable

- `telemetry`: An instance of the `Telemetry` class, used as a singleton.

## Constants

The module imports two constants from `const.telemetry`:

- `LARGE_REQUEST_THRESHOLD`: The threshold above which an LLM request is considered large.
- `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD`: The threshold above which an LLM request is considered slow.

## Integration with the Project

The `Telemetry` class is integrated into the GPT-Pilot application to collect telemetry data throughout the application's lifecycle. It is used to monitor the usage patterns, performance metrics, and potential issues that may arise during the operation of the application.

## Disabling Telemetry

Users can disable telemetry by modifying the configuration settings. The documentation on how to disable telemetry is provided in `../../docs/TELEMETRY.md`.

## Error Handling

The class includes error handling to ensure that telemetry does not interfere with the normal operation of the application. If telemetry is disabled or an error occurs during data collection or transmission, the methods will perform no operations (no-ops).

## Dependencies

The module depends on the `requests` library for sending HTTP requests, the `logging` module for logging, and the `uuid` module for generating unique identifiers. It also uses the `sys`, `time`, and `traceback` modules for system information and error handling.
