# spinner.py Module

The `spinner.py` module is part of the `pilot/utils` package within the project. It provides utility functions to display a command-line spinner to indicate progress or processing to the user. This module leverages the `yaspin` package, which is a dependency that must be installed for the module to function correctly.

## Dependencies

- `yaspin`: A library that provides a command-line spinner for indicating progress.

## Functions

### spinner_start

```python
def spinner_start(text="Processing..."):
```

#### Description

Initializes and starts a spinner with a specified text message. The spinner is displayed on the command line to indicate that a process is ongoing.

#### Parameters

- `text` (str, optional): The message to be displayed alongside the spinner. Defaults to `"Processing..."`.

#### Returns

- `spinner` (yaspin.core.Yaspin): An instance of the `Yaspin` class that represents the active spinner.

#### Usage

The function is called when a process that may take time is initiated. It provides visual feedback to the user that the process is running. The returned `spinner` object can be used to stop the spinner later.

#### Example

```python
spinner = spinner_start("Loading data")
# ... long-running operation ...
spinner_stop(spinner)
```

### spinner_stop

```python
def spinner_stop(spinner):
```

#### Description

Stops and removes the spinner from the command line. This function should be called when the process that was previously indicated by the spinner is complete.

#### Parameters

- `spinner` (yaspin.core.Yaspin): The spinner instance that was returned by `spinner_start` and is currently active.

#### Returns

- None

#### Usage

The function is called with the `spinner` object that was returned by `spinner_start`. It stops the spinner, indicating that the process has finished.

#### Example

```python
spinner = spinner_start("Processing data")
# ... long-running operation ...
spinner_stop(spinner)
```

## Module Details

- The module uses `Spinners.line` from `yaspin.spinners` as the default spinner style.
- The spinner is started by calling the `start()` method on the `yaspin` object.
- The spinner is stopped by calling the `stop()` method on the `yaspin` object.
- If `spinner_stop` is called with `None`, it will not attempt to stop a non-existent spinner, thus avoiding potential errors.

## Integration

This module is typically used in command-line applications or scripts where long-running operations occur, and user feedback is necessary to indicate that the system is active and not stalled.

## Error Handling

- The module does not explicitly handle any errors. It assumes that the `yaspin` package is correctly installed and that the functions are used as intended.
- If `spinner_stop` is called with an argument that is not a `yaspin` object or `None`, it may raise an error.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that `spinner_stop` is always called after `spinner_start` to properly clean up the command line interface.
- Use meaningful `text` messages that accurately describe the ongoing process to provide clear feedback to the user.
