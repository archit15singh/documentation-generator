# `test_llm_connection.py` Technical Documentation

## Overview
The `test_llm_connection.py` module contains a suite of tests designed to validate the functionality of JSON response cleaning, exception handling, and schema validation related to the interaction with a language model (LLM). It also includes tests for the connection to the LLM, specifically for rate limiting and streaming completions.

## Dependencies
- `builtins`
- `json.JSONDecodeError`
- `os`
- `pytest`
- `unittest.mock`
- `dotenv.load_dotenv`
- `jsonschema.ValidationError`
- `const.function_calls`
- `helpers.AgentConvo`
- `helpers.Project`
- `helpers.agents.Architect`
- `helpers.agents.TechLead`
- `utils.function_calling`
- `test.test_utils`
- `test.mock_questionary`
- `utils.llm_connection`
- `main.get_custom_print`

## Environment Setup
- Loads environment variables using `load_dotenv()`.
- Removes the `AUTOFIX_FILE_PATHS` environment variable if it exists.

## Test Cases

### `test_clean_json_response_True_False`
- Validates that the `clean_json_response` function correctly removes markdown and converts Title Case booleans to lowercase in a JSON response.

### `test_clean_json_response_boolean_in_python`
- Ensures that the `clean_json_response` function does not alter Python booleans within a string content of a JSON response.

### `TestRetryOnException`
- A test class that verifies the `retry_on_exception` decorator's ability to handle incomplete or invalid JSON responses and retry the wrapped function accordingly.
- Mocks the `styled_text` function to simulate user interaction without actual console output.
- Includes tests for various scenarios such as incomplete JSON strings, invalid booleans, invalid escape sequences, and extra data beyond the JSON object.

### `TestSchemaValidation`
- A test class that checks the `assert_json_response` and `assert_json_schema` functions to ensure they correctly validate JSON responses against a predefined schema.
- Includes tests for valid JSON, incomplete JSON, invalid JSON, and missing required properties in the JSON object.

### `TestLlmConnection`
- A test class that covers the functionality of the `stream_gpt_completion` and `create_gpt_chat_completion` functions, which are responsible for handling streaming responses from the LLM and creating chat completions, respectively.
- Mocks the `requests.post` function to simulate API responses from the LLM.
- Includes tests for handling rate limit errors and streaming JSON responses.
- Uses the `pytest.mark.uses_tokens` decorator to indicate tests that consume tokens from the LLM.
- Uses the `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to run tests with different combinations of endpoints and models.

## Usage
- The tests are designed to be run using the `pytest` framework.
- Mock objects and patches are used to simulate external dependencies and interactions.
- Environment variables are manipulated within tests to simulate different runtime conditions.
- Assertions are made to ensure that the functions under test behave as expected under various scenarios.

## Notes
- The tests are focused on the interaction with the LLM and do not cover the full functionality of the system.
- The tests make use of decorators like `patch` to replace functions with mock objects, allowing for controlled testing of specific components.
- The `assert_non_empty_string` utility function is used to validate that certain strings in the response are not empty, indicating a successful response from the LLM.
- The `MockQuestionary` class is used to simulate user input for interactive prompts during testing.
