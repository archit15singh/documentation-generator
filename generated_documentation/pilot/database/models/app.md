# App Model

## Overview

The `App` class is a model that represents an application entity within a database. It is defined in the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models/app.py` file and extends the `BaseModel` class, which provides common fields and behavior for all models in the project. The `App` model is associated with the `User` model through a foreign key relationship.

## Fields

- `user`: A `ForeignKeyField` that establishes a relationship between the `App` model and the `User` model. Each `App` instance is related to a single `User` instance, and a user can have multiple apps associated with them. The `backref='apps'` argument creates a reverse relationship, allowing access to a user's apps through the `apps` attribute on a `User` instance.

- `app_type`: A `CharField` that stores the type of the application. It is an optional field, as indicated by `null=True`, meaning that it can be left blank when creating an `App` instance.

- `name`: A `CharField` that stores the name of the application. Similar to `app_type`, it is an optional field and can be left blank.

- `status`: A `CharField` that stores the current status of the application. This field is also optional.

## Usage

### Creating an App Instance

To create a new `App` instance, you would typically instantiate the `App` class with the required fields. For example:

```python
from database.models.user import User
from database.models.app import App

# Assuming a User instance already exists
user_instance = User.get_by_id(user_id)

# Create a new App instance for the user
new_app = App.create(
    user=user_instance,
    app_type='web',
    name='My Web App',
    status='active'
)
```

### Querying Apps

To retrieve apps from the database, you can use the model's query interface provided by Peewee. For example, to get all apps for a specific user:

```python
apps = App.select().where(App.user == user_instance)
for app in apps:
    print(app.name, app.status)
```

### Updating an App

To update an existing `App` instance, you can modify its fields and then call the `save` method:

```python
app_instance = App.get_by_id(app_id)
app_instance.status = 'inactive'
app_instance.save()
```

### Deleting an App

To delete an `App` instance, you can call the `delete_instance` method:

```python
app_instance = App.get_by_id(app_id)
app_instance.delete_instance()
```

## Relationships

The `App` model has a foreign key relationship with the `User` model. This relationship is bidirectional:

- From `App` to `User`: Each `App` instance is linked to a single `User` instance, which can be accessed through the `user` field.
- From `User` to `App`: Each `User` instance can access its related `App` instances through the `apps` attribute, which is created by the `backref` argument in the `ForeignKeyField`.

## Model Inheritance

The `App` model inherits from `BaseModel`, which is a custom base class defined in the `database.models.components.base_models` module. `BaseModel` provides common functionality and fields that are shared across different models in the project, such as an auto-incrementing primary key and timestamp fields for tracking creation and modification times.

## File Location

The `App` model is located in the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models/app.py` file within the project's directory structure. This location follows a conventional pattern where models are stored in a `models` directory, grouped by their respective domain or functionality.
