# Base Models

## Overview

The `base_models.py` file defines the base class for ORM models using the Peewee library, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Python. This base class, named `BaseModel`, provides common fields and configurations that can be inherited by other model classes in the project. The file also includes the necessary imports and database connection setup based on the project's configuration.

## Imports

- `Model`, `UUIDField`, `DateTimeField`: Imported from the `peewee` module, these classes are used to define the model structure and field types.
- `datetime`: Imported from the `datetime` module, it is used to get the current date and time.
- `uuid4`: Imported from the `uuid` module, it is used to generate unique identifiers for the model instances.
- `DATABASE_TYPE`: Imported from the `database.config` module, it specifies the type of database being used (e.g., "postgres" or "sqlite").
- `get_postgres_database`: Imported from `database.connection.postgres`, it is a function that returns a Postgres database connection object.
- `get_sqlite_database`: Imported from `database.connection.sqlite`, it is a function that returns an SQLite database connection object.

## Database Connection Setup

The file checks the `DATABASE_TYPE` variable to determine which database to connect to. If `DATABASE_TYPE` is set to "postgres", it calls `get_postgres_database()` to establish a connection to a Postgres database. Otherwise, it defaults to calling `get_sqlite_database()` to connect to an SQLite database. The resulting database connection object is stored in the `database` variable.

## BaseModel Class

The `BaseModel` class is a subclass of Peewee's `Model` class and serves as the base class for all other model classes in the project. It defines the following fields:

- `id`: A `UUIDField` that serves as the primary key for the model. It defaults to a new UUID generated by `uuid4`.
- `created_at`: A `DateTimeField` that records the date and time when a model instance is created. It defaults to the current date and time, as provided by `datetime.now`.
- `updated_at`: A `DateTimeField` that records the date and time when a model instance is last updated. It also defaults to the current date and time.

### Meta Inner Class

The `BaseModel` class contains an inner class named `Meta`, which provides metadata to the Peewee ORM. The `Meta` class defines the following attribute:

- `database`: Set to the `database` variable, which holds the database connection object. This tells Peewee which database to use for the models that inherit from `BaseModel`.

## Usage

Other model classes in the project can inherit from `BaseModel` to automatically include the `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields and to use the database connection specified in the `BaseModel.Meta` class. This inheritance promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles by centralizing common model attributes and database configuration.

Example of inheriting from `BaseModel`:

```python
from .base_models import BaseModel

class MyModel(BaseModel):
    # Additional fields specific to MyModel
    pass
```

By inheriting from `BaseModel`, `MyModel` will have an `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` field, and it will use the same database connection as defined in `BaseModel.Meta`.
