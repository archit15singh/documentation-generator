# ProgressStep Model

## Overview
The `ProgressStep` class is a Python class that inherits from `BaseModel` and represents a database model within a project that uses the Peewee ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database. This model is designed to track the progress of certain steps within an application, referred to by the `app` field, which is a foreign key to the `App` model.

## Fields

### app
- **Type**: `ForeignKeyField`
- **References**: `App` model
- **Primary Key**: Yes
- **On Delete**: CASCADE
- **Description**: This field establishes a one-to-one relationship between `ProgressStep` and `App`. It is the primary key of the `ProgressStep` model, meaning each progress step is uniquely associated with a single application. The `CASCADE` option ensures that when an `App` record is deleted, the associated `ProgressStep` record is also deleted.

### step
- **Type**: `CharField`
- **Description**: This field stores a string that identifies the specific step in the progress tracking. It is a required field.

### app_data, data, messages
- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`
- **Nullable**: Yes (except for `app_data`)
- **Description**: These fields store JSON data. The type of field used depends on the `DATABASE_TYPE` configuration. If the database is PostgreSQL, `BinaryJSONField` is used, which allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data types. If another database type is used, `JSONField` is used instead. The `app_data` field is required, while `data` and `messages` are optional (`null=True`).

### completed
- **Type**: `BooleanField`
- **Default**: False
- **Description**: This boolean field indicates whether the step has been completed. By default, it is set to `False`.

### completed_at
- **Type**: `DateTimeField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: This field records the date and time when the step was completed. It is optional and can be `null` if the step has not been completed.

## Usage

### Creation
To create a new `ProgressStep` record, an instance of the `ProgressStep` class is instantiated with the required fields, and the `save()` method is called to persist the record to the database.

### Querying
The `ProgressStep` model can be queried using Peewee's query interface to retrieve progress steps, filter by completion status, or join with the `App` model to get related application data.

### Updating
Existing `ProgressStep` records can be updated by modifying the fields of an instance and calling the `save()` method. For example, setting the `completed` field to `True` and populating the `completed_at` field when a step is finished.

### Deletion
Records can be deleted individually using the `delete_instance()` method or in bulk using delete queries. Due to the `CASCADE` option on the `app` field, deleting an `App` record will automatically delete the associated `ProgressStep` record.

## Database Compatibility
The model is designed to be compatible with different database types. The use of `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField` is conditional based on the `DATABASE_TYPE` setting, allowing for flexibility and optimization based on the underlying database system.

## Model Inheritance
The `ProgressStep` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides common fields and functionality such as an ID field, timestamps for creation and modification, and any other base configuration required by all models in the project.
