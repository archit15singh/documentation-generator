# `sqlite_middlewares.py` Module

## Overview

The `sqlite_middlewares.py` module defines custom field types for use with the Peewee ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) when interfacing with an SQLite database. This module is specifically tailored for projects that require the storage and retrieval of JSON data within SQLite database fields.

## Classes

### `JSONField`

The `JSONField` class is a subclass of Peewee's `TextField` and is designed to store and retrieve JSON data. It overrides two methods from the `TextField` class to handle the serialization and deserialization of JSON data when writing to or reading from the database.

#### Methods

##### `python_value(self, value)`

- **Description**: This method is responsible for converting the JSON string retrieved from the SQLite database back into a Python dictionary or list. It is called automatically by Peewee when accessing the field value in Python.
- **Parameters**:
  - `value` (str): A JSON-formatted string retrieved from the SQLite database.
- **Returns**: The method returns a Python object (typically a dictionary or list) if `value` is not `None`. If `value` is `None`, it returns `None`.
- **Usage**: This method is used internally by Peewee and should not be called directly. When a model instance with a `JSONField` is retrieved from the database, Peewee calls `python_value` to deserialize the JSON field's content.

##### `db_value(self, value)`

- **Description**: This method is responsible for converting a Python dictionary or list into a JSON-formatted string before storing it in the SQLite database. It is called automatically by Peewee when saving or updating the field value in the database.
- **Parameters**:
  - `value` (dict or list): A Python dictionary or list that needs to be serialized into a JSON string.
- **Returns**: The method returns a JSON-formatted string if `value` is not `None`. If `value` is `None`, it returns `None`.
- **Usage**: This method is used internally by Peewee and should not be called directly. When a model instance with a `JSONField` is saved or updated, Peewee calls `db_value` to serialize the field's content into JSON format for storage in the database.

## Usage in a Project

The `JSONField` class is typically used in a Peewee model to define a field that will store JSON data. Here is an example of how it might be used within a Peewee model:

```python
from peewee import Model
from .sqlite_middlewares import JSONField

class MyModel(Model):
    data = JSONField()

    # Other fields and model configuration here
```

When instances of `MyModel` are saved, the `data` field will automatically serialize the assigned Python dictionary or list into a JSON string. Conversely, when instances of `MyModel` are retrieved from the database, the `data` field will automatically deserialize the JSON string back into a Python dictionary or list.

## Integration with SQLite

SQLite does not have a native JSON data type, so the `JSONField` uses a text field to store the JSON data as a string. The `JSONField` class ensures that the data is properly serialized and deserialized when interacting with the database, providing a seamless experience for storing and retrieving structured JSON data within an SQLite database using the Peewee ORM.
