# User Model

## Overview

The `User` model is a Python class that represents the structure of the user data within the application's database. It is defined in the file `user.py` located in the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models` directory. This model is a part of the project's database models and extends the `BaseModel` class, which provides common fields and behavior for all models in the application.

## Fields

The `User` model consists of the following fields:

- `email`: A `CharField` that stores the user's email address. This field is marked as `unique`, meaning that each user must have a distinct email address within the database.
- `password`: A `CharField` that stores the user's password. There are no additional constraints on this field, such as minimum length or complexity requirements, as defined in the provided code snippet.

## Inheritance

The `User` model inherits from the `BaseModel` class, which is defined in the `base_models.py` file within the same `database/models/components` directory. The `BaseModel` class is expected to provide common functionality to all models, such as database connection management, timestamp fields for tracking creation and modification times, and any other shared behavior or fields.

## Usage

The `User` model is used to interact with the `users` table in the database. It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user records. The model's fields define the schema of the `users` table, with the `email` and `password` columns corresponding to the fields in the `User` class.

### Creating a User

To create a new user, an instance of the `User` model is created with the `email` and `password` fields provided. The instance is then saved to the database, which inserts a new record into the `users` table.

Example:

```python
new_user = User(email='user@example.com', password='securepassword')
new_user.save()
```

### Retrieving a User

To retrieve a user from the database, queries are made using the `User` model. The `email` field can be used to look up a user due to its uniqueness constraint.

Example:

```python
user = User.get(User.email == 'user@example.com')
```

### Updating a User

To update an existing user's information, the user record is retrieved, modified, and saved back to the database.

Example:

```python
user = User.get(User.email == 'user@example.com')
user.password = 'newsecurepassword'
user.save()
```

### Deleting a User

To delete a user record from the database, the user is retrieved and then deleted.

Example:

```python
user = User.get(User.email == 'user@example.com')
user.delete_instance()
```

## Dependencies

The `User` model depends on the `peewee` library for defining fields and interacting with the database. The `CharField` class is imported from `peewee` and used to define the `email` and `password` fields.

## File Location

The `User` model is defined in the `user.py` file, which is located at the following path:

```
/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models/user.py
```

This location is within the `models` subdirectory of the `database` directory, which is part of the `pilot` module of the `documentation-generator` workspace.
