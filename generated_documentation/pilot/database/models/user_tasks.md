# UserTasks Model

## Overview
The `UserTasks` class is a Python class that extends the `ProgressStep` model, which is presumably a part of a larger application's database models. This class is designed to represent a table in a database that stores user tasks, with the ability to handle different database types, specifically PostgreSQL and SQLite.

## Attributes
- `user_tasks`: This attribute stores JSON data that represents the tasks associated with a user. The type of field used to store this JSON data is dependent on the database backend specified by the `DATABASE_TYPE` variable.

## Database Compatibility
The `UserTasks` model is designed to be compatible with two types of databases:
1. **PostgreSQL**: When the `DATABASE_TYPE` is set to `'postgres'`, the `user_tasks` attribute uses `BinaryJSONField` from the `playhouse.postgres_ext` module. This field type is optimized for storing JSON data in a binary format in a PostgreSQL database, which allows for efficient querying and indexing.
2. **SQLite**: If the `DATABASE_TYPE` is not set to `'postgres'`, it defaults to using a custom `JSONField` defined in the `database.models.components.sqlite_middlewares` module. This custom field is tailored to store JSON data in an SQLite database, which does not natively support a binary JSON field type.

## Inheritance
- Inherits from `ProgressStep`: The `UserTasks` model is a subclass of the `ProgressStep` model. This implies that it inherits any fields and methods from the `ProgressStep` class, in addition to the `user_tasks` attribute defined specifically for the `UserTasks` model.

## Meta Class
- `table_name`: Within the nested `Meta` class, the `table_name` attribute is set to `'user_tasks'`. This specifies the name of the table in the database that corresponds to this model. When the model is used to interact with the database, it will refer to or create a table with the name `user_tasks`.

## Usage
The `UserTasks` model is used to create, query, update, and delete entries in the `user_tasks` table of the database. Depending on the database backend in use, the model will adapt to use the appropriate JSON field type. This model can be utilized by other parts of the application that need to manage user task data, such as a task management system or a user progress tracking feature.

### Example Usage
Here is an example of how the `UserTasks` model might be used in a project:

```python
from database.models.user_tasks import UserTasks

# Assuming DATABASE_TYPE is set to 'postgres'

# Create a new user task entry
new_task = UserTasks.create(user_tasks={'task_id': 1, 'description': 'Set up project environment'})

# Query for a specific user task entry
task = UserTasks.get(UserTasks.id == some_task_id)

# Update a user task entry
task.user_tasks['status'] = 'completed'
task.save()

# Delete a user task entry
task.delete_instance()
```

In this example, the `UserTasks` model is used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `user_tasks` table. The JSON data for the tasks is manipulated as a Python dictionary, and the model handles the serialization and deserialization to and from the database's JSON or Binary JSON field type.
