# Development Model

## Overview

The `Development` class is a Python class that inherits from the `ProgressStep` class, which is presumably a part of a larger application's database models, specifically related to tracking the progress of certain steps or tasks. The `Development` class represents a specific type of progress step that is stored in a database table named 'development'.

## Inheritance

The `Development` class extends the `ProgressStep` class, which means it inherits all the methods, attributes, and properties of the `ProgressStep` class. This inheritance implies that `Development` is a specialized form of `ProgressStep` that may add additional functionality or simply serve as a semantic distinction within the application's domain.

## Meta Class

Within the `Development` class, there is an inner class named `Meta`. This inner class is a convention used in many ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) to provide metadata about the model it is contained within.

### table_name Attribute

The `Meta` class defines a single attribute, `table_name`, which is set to the string `'development'`. This attribute specifies the name of the database table that the `Development` model is associated with. When the ORM interacts with the database, it will refer to the 'development' table for operations involving instances of the `Development` class.

## Usage

The `Development` model is used by the application to interact with the corresponding 'development' table in the database. Here are some potential ways the `Development` model might be used in the project:

### Creating a New Development Record

An instance of the `Development` class can be created and saved to the database, representing a new record in the 'development' table. This would typically involve setting various attributes inherited from `ProgressStep` and any that are unique to `Development`, then calling a method to save the instance to the database.

```python
development_instance = Development()
# Set attributes...
development_instance.save()
```

### Querying Development Records

The `Development` model can be used to query the 'development' table for existing records. This could involve filtering based on certain criteria, ordering the results, or retrieving a single record by its primary key.

```python
# Retrieve all development records
all_developments = Development.all()

# Retrieve a specific development record by primary key
specific_development = Development.get_by_id(some_primary_key)

# Retrieve development records with filtering and ordering
filtered_developments = Development.where(some_condition).order_by(some_ordering)
```

### Updating a Development Record

After retrieving an instance of the `Development` model from the database, its attributes can be modified, and the instance can be saved back to the database to update the corresponding record.

```python
development_instance = Development.get_by_id(some_primary_key)
development_instance.some_attribute = new_value
development_instance.save()
```

### Deleting a Development Record

An instance of the `Development` model can be deleted from the database, which removes the corresponding record from the 'development' table.

```python
development_instance = Development.get_by_id(some_primary_key)
development_instance.delete()
```

## Conclusion

The `Development` model is a crucial part of the application's data layer, allowing for structured and efficient interaction with the 'development' table in the database. It leverages the functionality provided by the `ProgressStep` parent class and specifies the table it is associated with through the `Meta` inner class.
