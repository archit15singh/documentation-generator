# DevelopmentPlanning Model

## Overview

The `DevelopmentPlanning` class is a Python class that inherits from the `ProgressStep` model. It represents a specific type of progress step within a project, focusing on development planning. This class is part of a larger application that uses a database to store its data, and it is defined within the `development_planning.py` file located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models/`.

## Database Configuration

The `DevelopmentPlanning` model is designed to be compatible with different types of databases. It uses the `DATABASE_TYPE` variable imported from `database.config` to determine which database-specific field type to use for storing JSON data.

## Fields

### development_plan

- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`, depending on the `DATABASE_TYPE`.
- **Description**: This field is used to store JSON data that represents the development plan associated with the `DevelopmentPlanning` instance. The JSON structure can include various details about the development process, such as tasks, milestones, resources, and timelines.

  - If `DATABASE_TYPE` is set to `'postgres'`, the `development_plan` field will be a `BinaryJSONField`, which is a specialized field type provided by the `playhouse.postgres_ext` module for storing JSON data in a binary format in a PostgreSQL database. This field type allows for efficient querying and indexing of JSON data within PostgreSQL.
  
  - If `DATABASE_TYPE` is not set to `'postgres'`, the `development_plan` field will be a `JSONField`. This is a custom field type defined in the `sqlite_middlewares` module, which is intended for use with SQLite databases. The `JSONField` provides a way to store and retrieve JSON data in a SQLite database, which does not natively support a JSON data type.

## Meta Class

The `Meta` inner class within the `DevelopmentPlanning` model contains metadata for the model.

### table_name

- **Type**: `str`
- **Value**: `'development_planning'`
- **Description**: This attribute specifies the name of the database table that corresponds to the `DevelopmentPlanning` model. When instances of `DevelopmentPlanning` are saved to the database, they will be stored in the `development_planning` table.

## Usage

The `DevelopmentPlanning` model is used to create, read, update, and delete records in the database that pertain to the development planning phase of a project. It is a part of the application's data layer and interacts with the database through an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system.

When an instance of `DevelopmentPlanning` is created and saved, it will be inserted into the `development_planning` table in the database. The choice of JSON field type ensures that the model can be used with either PostgreSQL or SQLite, making the application more flexible and adaptable to different deployment environments.

The `DevelopmentPlanning` model can be used in various parts of the application, such as in views that handle project management, in services that process development plans, or in background tasks that analyze the progress of a project.

## Example

Here is an example of how the `DevelopmentPlanning` model might be used in the application:

```python
from database.models.development_planning import DevelopmentPlanning

# Create a new development planning record
new_plan = DevelopmentPlanning(development_plan={
    "milestones": [
        {"name": "Prototype", "deadline": "2023-06-01"},
        {"name": "Beta Release", "deadline": "2023-09-01"}
    ],
    "resources": {
        "budget": 100000,
        "personnel": ["Developer A", "Designer B"]
    }
})

# Save the new plan to the database
new_plan.save()

# Query the database for a specific development plan
plan = DevelopmentPlanning.get(DevelopmentPlanning.id == 1)

# Update the development plan
plan.development_plan['resources']['budget'] = 120000
plan.save()

# Delete a development plan
plan.delete_instance()
```

In this example, the `DevelopmentPlanning` model is used to create a new development plan, save it to the database, retrieve it, update it, and finally delete it. The JSON data structure allows for complex data to be stored and manipulated within the `development_plan` field.
