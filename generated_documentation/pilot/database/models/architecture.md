# Architecture Model

## Overview

The `Architecture` class is a Python model that represents a database table named `architecture`. This model is a subclass of `ProgressStep`, which implies that it inherits fields and behaviors from the `ProgressStep` model, potentially representing a step in a larger workflow or process. The `Architecture` model is designed to be compatible with different types of databases, specifically PostgreSQL and SQLite, by conditionally defining the type of the `architecture` field based on the database in use.

## Fields

- `architecture`: This field stores JSON data. The type of this field changes depending on the value of the `DATABASE_TYPE` variable imported from `database.config`. If `DATABASE_TYPE` is set to `'postgres'`, the field is a `BinaryJSONField` provided by `playhouse.postgres_ext`, which is optimized for PostgreSQL databases and stores JSON data in a binary format. If `DATABASE_TYPE` is anything other than `'postgres'`, the field is a `JSONField`, which is a custom field for SQLite databases, allowing for the storage of JSON data in a SQLite-compatible format.

## Meta Class

- `table_name`: Within the nested `Meta` class, the `table_name` attribute is explicitly set to `'architecture'`. This attribute specifies the name of the database table that the `Architecture` model represents.

## Usage

The `Architecture` model is used to create, read, update, and delete records in the `architecture` table of the database. The model's structure allows for the storage of JSON data, which can be used to represent complex data structures such as the architecture of a software application, a network, or any other system that can be described in JSON format.

Depending on the database backend specified by `DATABASE_TYPE`, the model will adapt the type of the `architecture` field to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. For instance, when using PostgreSQL, the `architecture` field will leverage the native JSONB capabilities of the database for efficient storage and querying. On the other hand, when using SQLite, the custom `JSONField` middleware will handle the JSON data in a way that is compatible with SQLite's storage mechanisms.

When interacting with the `Architecture` model, developers can perform typical database operations such as creating new records, querying existing records, updating records, and deleting records. The JSON data stored in the `architecture` field can be accessed and manipulated using the standard query interface provided by the underlying ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, Peewee.

## Integration with Other Components

The `Architecture` model is part of a larger application and interacts with other components within the project:

- It inherits from the `ProgressStep` model, which may contain additional fields and methods that are common to all steps in a workflow.
- It utilizes custom middleware from `database.models.components.sqlite_middlewares`, specifically the `JSONField`, to handle JSON data in SQLite databases.
- It relies on the `DATABASE_TYPE` configuration variable from `database.config` to determine the appropriate field type for the `architecture` field.

Developers working with the `Architecture` model should be aware of these interactions and the configuration of the `DATABASE_TYPE` to ensure that the model behaves as expected within the context of the project.
