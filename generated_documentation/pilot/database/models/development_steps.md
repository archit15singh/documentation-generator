# DevelopmentSteps Model

## Overview
The `DevelopmentSteps` class is a Peewee ORM model that represents a table in the database used to store information about various steps in the development process of an application. This model is part of a larger project that tracks the development progress of applications.

## Fields

### id
- **Type**: `AutoField`
- **Description**: Serves as the primary key for the `development_steps` table. It is an auto-incrementing integer field that uniquely identifies each record.

### app
- **Type**: `ForeignKeyField` referencing the `App` model
- **Description**: Establishes a foreign key relationship with the `App` model, linking each development step to a specific application.
- **On Delete**: `CASCADE` - When the referenced application is deleted, all associated development steps are also deleted.

### prompt_path
- **Type**: `TextField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: Stores the file path or identifier for the prompt associated with the development step.

### llm_req_num
- **Type**: `IntegerField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: Records the number of requests made to a language learning model (LLM) during this development step.

### token_limit_exception_raised
- **Type**: `TextField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: Captures any token limit exceptions that may have been raised during the processing of this step.

### messages
- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: Stores a JSON object containing messages related to the development step. The field type is `BinaryJSONField` if `DATABASE_TYPE` is 'postgres', otherwise, it is a custom `JSONField` for SQLite.

### llm_response
- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`
- **Nullable**: No
- **Description**: Stores the JSON response from the language learning model. The field type is `BinaryJSONField` if `DATABASE_TYPE` is 'postgres', otherwise, it is a custom `JSONField` for SQLite.

### prompt_data
- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: Contains JSON data related to the prompt used in this development step. The field type is `BinaryJSONField` if `DATABASE_TYPE` is 'postgres', otherwise, it is a custom `JSONField` for SQLite.

### previous_step
- **Type**: `ForeignKeyField` referencing `self`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Column Name**: `previous_step`
- **Description**: Establishes a self-referential foreign key relationship, linking a development step to its preceding step in the sequence.

### high_level_step
- **Type**: `CharField`
- **Nullable**: Yes
- **Description**: A textual description or identifier for a high-level step in the development process.

## Meta

### table_name
- **Value**: `development_steps`
- **Description**: Specifies the name of the table in the database.

### indexes
- **Value**: `(('app', 'previous_step', 'high_level_step'), True)`
- **Description**: Creates a composite unique index on the `app`, `previous_step`, and `high_level_step` fields, ensuring that there are no duplicate entries for these combinations.

## Usage

The `DevelopmentSteps` model is used to track and store individual steps in the development process of applications. Each record in the `development_steps` table corresponds to a specific action or event in the development lifecycle, such as a request to a language learning model or an exception encountered.

The model supports relationships to other models, such as the `App` model, allowing for a structured and relational approach to tracking development progress. The use of JSON fields provides flexibility in storing complex data structures related to development steps, such as messages and responses from external services.

The self-referential `previous_step` field enables the chaining of development steps, allowing for the reconstruction of the sequence of events in the development process. The unique index on `app`, `previous_step`, and `high_level_step` ensures the integrity of this sequence by preventing duplicate entries.

Overall, the `DevelopmentSteps` model is a crucial component of the project's database schema, facilitating the detailed tracking and analysis of the application development workflow.
