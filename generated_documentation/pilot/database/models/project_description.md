# ProjectDescription Model

## Overview

The `ProjectDescription` class is a Python model that represents a specific type of data record in the application's database. It is designed to store textual information related to a project, specifically a prompt and a summary of the project. This model extends the `ProgressStep` class, indicating that it is a part of a sequence of steps or stages in a project's lifecycle.

## Fields

- `prompt`: A `TextField` that is used to store a detailed question or statement that guides the user in providing a description of the project. This field is intended to capture the essence of what the project is about or what it aims to achieve.
  
- `summary`: Another `TextField` that holds a concise overview or abstract of the project. This field is meant to provide a quick snapshot of the project's purpose and scope.

## Meta Class

- `table_name`: Within the nested `Meta` class, the `table_name` attribute is set to `'project_description'`. This attribute explicitly specifies the name of the table in the database where records of the `ProjectDescription` model will be stored.

## Inheritance

The `ProjectDescription` class inherits from the `ProgressStep` class. The `ProgressStep` class is not defined within this file but is imported from `database.models.components.progress_step`. The inheritance implies that `ProjectDescription` includes all fields and methods from `ProgressStep`, in addition to its own fields (`prompt` and `summary`). This also suggests that `ProjectDescription` is likely to be part of a larger workflow or process tracking system where each step is recorded and monitored.

## Usage

The `ProjectDescription` model is typically used in the following way within the project:

1. **Model Initialization**: An instance of `ProjectDescription` is created by providing values for the `prompt` and `summary` fields. This instance represents a single record in the `project_description` table.

2. **Data Persistence**: The instance can be saved to the database, which will insert a new record or update an existing one in the `project_description` table with the values provided.

3. **Data Retrieval**: The model can be used to query the database for existing project descriptions. This can be done by searching for specific prompts, summaries, or by using any inherited fields or methods from the `ProgressStep` class.

4. **Data Manipulation**: The retrieved instances can be modified by changing the values of the `prompt` and `summary` fields and then saving the changes to the database.

5. **Workflow Integration**: As part of the inherited `ProgressStep` functionality, the `ProjectDescription` may be used to track the progress of a project by marking this step as complete or in progress, depending on the workflow logic implemented in the `ProgressStep` class.

## Database Schema Integration

The `ProjectDescription` model directly affects the database schema. When the application's database migrations are run, a table named `project_description` will be created with the following columns:

- A primary key column (inherited from `ProgressStep`, not visible in this file).
- `prompt`: A text column to store the project prompt.
- `summary`: A text column to store the project summary.

Additional columns and relationships may be present, inherited from the `ProgressStep` class.

## Conclusion

The `ProjectDescription` model is a crucial part of the application's data layer, allowing for structured storage, retrieval, and manipulation of project descriptions within the context of a project's progress tracking system.
