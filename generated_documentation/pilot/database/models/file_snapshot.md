# FileSnapshot Model

## Overview
The `FileSnapshot` model is a Python class that represents a snapshot of a file's content at a particular stage in the development process within a database. It is part of a project's database schema and is used to store and retrieve the state of a file's content as it evolves over time. This model is defined in the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/models/file_snapshot.py` file and utilizes the Peewee ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interaction with the database.

## Dependencies
- `logging`: Used for logging warnings when a string is provided to the `SmartBlobField` instead of bytes.
- `peewee`: Provides the ORM functionality, specifically `ForeignKeyField` and `BlobField` which are used in the model.
- `database.models.components.base_models.BaseModel`: The base model class that `FileSnapshot` inherits from, providing common fields and behavior.
- `database.models.development_steps.DevelopmentSteps`: Represents the development step associated with the file snapshot.
- `database.models.app.App`: Represents the application to which the file snapshot belongs.
- `database.models.files.File`: Represents the file associated with the snapshot.

## SmartBlobField Class
A custom field derived from `BlobField` that can handle both binary data and UTF-8 strings. It overrides two methods:
- `db_value(self, value)`: Converts a string value to bytes using UTF-8 encoding before storing it in the database. Logs a warning if a string is passed instead of bytes.
- `python_value(self, value)`: Attempts to decode the binary data from the database to a UTF-8 string. If decoding fails due to a `UnicodeDecodeError`, it returns the original binary data.

## FileSnapshot Class
A Peewee model class that inherits from `BaseModel` and represents a snapshot of a file's content in the database.

### Fields
- `app`: A `ForeignKeyField` that links to the `App` model. It represents the application to which the file snapshot belongs. The `on_delete='CASCADE'` parameter ensures that when an `App` record is deleted, all associated `FileSnapshot` records are also deleted.
- `development_step`: A `ForeignKeyField` that links to the `DevelopmentSteps` model. It represents the development step during which the snapshot was taken. The `backref='files'` parameter creates a reverse relationship, allowing access to file snapshots from a development step. The `on_delete='CASCADE'` parameter ensures that when a `DevelopmentSteps` record is deleted, all associated `FileSnapshot` records are also deleted.
- `file`: A `ForeignKeyField` that links to the `File` model. It represents the file associated with the snapshot. The `on_delete='CASCADE'` parameter ensures that when a `File` record is deleted, the associated `FileSnapshot` record is also deleted. The `null=True` parameter allows the field to be null, indicating that a snapshot may exist without a corresponding file record.
- `content`: A `SmartBlobField` that stores the content of the file snapshot. It can handle both binary data and UTF-8 strings.

### Meta Class
An inner class that provides additional metadata to the Peewee ORM:
- `table_name`: Specifies the name of the table in the database to which the model corresponds.
- `indexes`: Defines a composite unique index on the `development_step` and `file` fields, ensuring that there cannot be duplicate snapshots for the same file at the same development step.

## Usage
The `FileSnapshot` model is used to create, query, update, and delete records in the `file_snapshot` table of the database. It is typically used in the context of tracking changes to files over the course of an application's development lifecycle. By associating snapshots with specific development steps and applications, the model facilitates version control and historical data analysis.

## Example
To create a new file snapshot, one would instantiate the `FileSnapshot` class with the appropriate `app`, `development_step`, `file`, and `content` data, and then call the `save()` method to persist the record to the database.

```python
new_snapshot = FileSnapshot.create(
    app=some_app_instance,
    development_step=some_development_step_instance,
    file=some_file_instance,
    content=b'Some binary content'
)
new_snapshot.save()
```

To query for a specific file snapshot, one might use the `FileSnapshot.select()` method with the appropriate filters.

```python
snapshot = FileSnapshot.select().where(
    (FileSnapshot.development_step == some_development_step_instance) &
    (FileSnapshot.file == some_file_instance)
).get()
```
```
