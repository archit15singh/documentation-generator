# CommandRuns Model

## Overview
The `CommandRuns` class is a Python class that defines the structure of the `command_runs` table in a database using the Peewee ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). This class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides common fields and behavior for all models in the project.

## Fields

- `id`: An auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for the `command_runs` table. It is defined using `AutoField`.
- `app`: A foreign key that references the `App` model. This establishes a many-to-one relationship between `CommandRuns` and `App`, where each command run is associated with a specific application. The `on_delete='CASCADE'` parameter ensures that if the referenced app is deleted, all associated command runs are also deleted.
- `command`: A text field that stores the command that was executed. It is nullable, meaning it can be left blank.
- `cli_response`: A text field that stores the response from the command-line interface after executing the command. It is also nullable.
- `done_or_error_response`: A text field that stores the final response from the command execution, which could be a success message or an error message. This field is nullable as well.
- `exit_code`: An integer field that stores the exit code returned by the command execution. A non-zero exit code typically indicates an error. This field is nullable.
- `previous_step`: A self-referential foreign key that points to another `CommandRuns` record. This allows for the creation of a linked list structure to track the sequence of command runs. It is nullable and references the `id` field of another `CommandRuns` record through the `column_name='previous_step'` parameter.
- `high_level_step`: A character field that stores a description or identifier for a high-level step in a process. This field is nullable.

## Meta Class

The `Meta` subclass within `CommandRuns` provides additional metadata to the Peewee ORM about the `command_runs` table:

- `table_name`: Specifies the name of the table in the database as 'command_runs'.
- `indexes`: Defines a composite index on the `app`, `previous_step`, and `high_level_step` fields. The `True` value indicates that this is a unique index, meaning that the combination of these three fields must be unique across all records in the table.

## Usage

The `CommandRuns` model is used to track the execution of commands within an application. Each record represents a single command run, including the command itself, the response from the CLI, the final outcome, and the exit code. The model also allows for tracking the sequence of command runs and categorizing them by high-level steps.

When a command is executed within the application, a new `CommandRuns` record can be created with the relevant details. The `app` field links the command run to the specific application it belongs to. If the command is part of a sequence, the `previous_step` field can be used to link it to the preceding command run. The `high_level_step` field can be used to group related command runs together.

The unique index on `app`, `previous_step`, and `high_level_step` ensures that there are no duplicate sequences of command runs for the same application and high-level step, which helps maintain data integrity.

Overall, the `CommandRuns` model is a crucial part of the project's database schema, enabling detailed tracking and analysis of command executions within applications.
