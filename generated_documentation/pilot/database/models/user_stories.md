# UserStories Model

## Overview
The `UserStories` class is a Python class that extends the `ProgressStep` model, which is presumably a part of a larger application's database models. This class is designed to represent user stories within the application's database. The `UserStories` model includes a single field named `user_stories` that stores JSON data. The type of JSON field used is determined by the `DATABASE_TYPE` configuration.

## Fields

### user_stories
- **Type**: `BinaryJSONField` or `JSONField`
- **Description**: This field is used to store JSON data that represents the user stories. The JSON structure can include various attributes of a user story such as title, description, acceptance criteria, etc. The exact structure of the JSON data is not specified in the provided code snippet.

## Database Configuration

The model uses a conditional statement to determine which type of JSON field to use based on the `DATABASE_TYPE` configuration value.

- If `DATABASE_TYPE` is set to `'postgres'`, the `user_stories` field will be of type `BinaryJSONField`. This field type is specific to PostgreSQL databases and allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data.
- If `DATABASE_TYPE` is not set to `'postgres'`, the `user_stories` field will use a custom `JSONField` designed for SQLite databases. This custom field is likely implemented to provide JSON capabilities in SQLite, which does not natively support JSON data types as PostgreSQL does.

## Meta Class

The `Meta` inner class within the `UserStories` model specifies additional metadata for the model.

### table_name
- **Type**: `str`
- **Value**: `'user_stories'`
- **Description**: This attribute sets the name of the database table to `'user_stories'`. When the model is used to interact with the database, it will refer to the table with this name.

## Usage

The `UserStories` model is used to interact with the database table named `'user_stories'`. It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user story records in the database. The JSON data stored in the `user_stories` field can be manipulated as per the application's requirements to maintain the user stories throughout the lifecycle of the project.

The choice of JSON field type ensures compatibility with the underlying database system, whether it is PostgreSQL or SQLite, providing flexibility in the deployment environment of the application.

## Integration with ProgressStep

Since `UserStories` extends `ProgressStep`, it inherits all fields and methods from the `ProgressStep` model. This implies that `UserStories` is a type of progress step within the application, and it likely includes additional fields and behaviors defined in the `ProgressStep` model. The integration with `ProgressStep` suggests that user stories are part of a larger workflow or process tracking system within the application.

## Example Usage

To create a new user story, an instance of the `UserStories` model would be instantiated, and the `user_stories` field would be populated with the appropriate JSON data. After setting any other inherited fields from `ProgressStep`, the instance can be saved to the database.

```python
new_user_story = UserStories(user_stories={'title': 'Implement login feature', 'description': 'As a user, I want to be able to log in to the system so that I can access my personalized dashboard.'})
new_user_story.save()
```

To query user stories from the database, the `UserStories` model can be used to perform queries, and the results can be filtered, ordered, or manipulated as needed.

```python
user_story_query = UserStories.select().where(UserStories.user_stories['title'] == 'Implement login feature')
for user_story in user_story_query:
    print(user_story.user_stories)
```

The `UserStories` model is a crucial part of the application's data layer, providing structured access to user stories, which are a key component of agile project management and development processes.
