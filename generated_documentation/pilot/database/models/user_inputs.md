# UserInputs Model

## Overview
The `UserInputs` class is a Python class that defines the structure of the `user_inputs` table in a database using the Peewee ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). This class inherits from `BaseModel`, which is a custom base class defined in the `database.models.components.base_models` module. The `UserInputs` model is designed to store user input data related to a specific application within the project.

## Fields

### id
- **Type**: `AutoField`
- **Description**: This is the primary key field that automatically increments with each new record. It uniquely identifies each entry in the `user_inputs` table.

### app
- **Type**: `ForeignKeyField`
- **References**: `App` model
- **On Delete**: `CASCADE`
- **Description**: This field establishes a foreign key relationship with the `App` model, linking each user input to a specific application. If the referenced application is deleted, all associated user input records will also be deleted due to the `CASCADE` delete behavior.

### query
- **Type**: `TextField`
- **Nullable**: `True`
- **Description**: This field is used to store a text-based query that may be associated with the user input. It is nullable, meaning it can be left blank if not applicable.

### user_input
- **Type**: `TextField`
- **Nullable**: `True`
- **Description**: This field stores the actual input provided by the user. It is also nullable, allowing for records without direct user input.

### hint
- **Type**: `TextField`
- **Nullable**: `True`
- **Description**: This field can store an optional hint or guidance related to the user input. It is designed to be nullable to accommodate situations where no hint is necessary.

### previous_step
- **Type**: `ForeignKeyField`
- **References**: `UserInputs` model (self-referential)
- **Column Name**: `previous_step`
- **Nullable**: `True`
- **Description**: This self-referential foreign key points to another record in the same `user_inputs` table, indicating a sequential relationship between user inputs. It allows for the tracking of user input sequences or steps. Being nullable, it can accommodate initial steps that do not have a predecessor.

### high_level_step
- **Type**: `CharField`
- **Nullable**: `True`
- **Description**: This field is intended to store a high-level description or identifier for the step associated with the user input. It is nullable to allow for flexibility in how steps are categorized or if such categorization is not needed.

## Meta Class

### table_name
- **Value**: `'user_inputs'`
- **Description**: This meta attribute explicitly sets the name of the table in the database to `user_inputs`.

### indexes
- **Value**: `((('app', 'previous_step', 'high_level_step'), True),)`
- **Description**: This meta attribute defines a composite index on the `app`, `previous_step`, and `high_level_step` fields. The `True` value indicates that this index is unique, meaning that there cannot be duplicate combinations of these three fields within the table.

## Usage
The `UserInputs` model is used to create, read, update, and delete records in the `user_inputs` table of the database. It is typically utilized by the application's backend logic to store and retrieve user interactions with the application, such as queries, inputs, and the sequence of steps taken by the user. The model's structure and relationships enable the application to maintain a history of user inputs, which can be used for features like undo/redo, analytics, or user experience improvements.
