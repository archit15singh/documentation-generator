# Configuration Module: `config.py`

## Overview

The `config.py` module is part of the `database` package within the `pilot` project. It is responsible for setting up and providing database configuration parameters to other parts of the application. The module uses environment variables to allow for flexible deployment configurations, with support for default values.

## Configuration Variables

### `DATABASE_TYPE`

- **Description**: Specifies the type of database to be used.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `"sqlite"`
- **Usage**: This variable determines the database engine that the application will connect to. It defaults to SQLite if not specified. Other possible values could be `"mysql"`, `"postgresql"`, etc., depending on the supported database types by the application.

### `DB_NAME`

- **Description**: The name of the database to connect to.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Usage**: This variable is essential for identifying the specific database on the server. It must be set if the application is using a database server that requires a database name.

### `DB_HOST`

- **Description**: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Usage**: This variable is used to specify where the database server is running. It is not required for SQLite but is necessary for most other database types.

### `DB_PORT`

- **Description**: The port number on which the database server is listening.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Usage**: This variable is used in conjunction with `DB_HOST` to form the complete network address of the database server. It is typically required for networked databases.

### `DB_USER`

- **Description**: The username used to authenticate with the database.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Usage**: This variable is necessary for databases that require authentication. It represents the user that the application will use to connect to the database.

### `DB_PASSWORD`

- **Description**: The password used to authenticate with the database.
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `None`
- **Usage**: This variable works in tandem with `DB_USER` to provide the credentials required for connecting to the database. It is critical for maintaining secure access to the database.

## Usage in the Project

The configuration variables defined in `config.py` are used throughout the `pilot` project to configure database connections and access. The variables are read from the environment, allowing for different deployment environments (development, testing, production) to specify their own values without changing the codebase.

For example, a database connection module would use these variables to construct a connection string or a database URI, which is then used to establish a connection to the database server.

## Environment Variables

The module relies on the following environment variables, which should be set prior to running the application:

- `DATABASE_TYPE`
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_PASSWORD`

If these variables are not set in the environment, the application will use the default values where provided, such as `"sqlite"` for `DATABASE_TYPE`. For other variables without defaults, the application may fail to start or connect to the database if the values are not provided.

## Security Considerations

Sensitive information such as `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` should be handled securely. It is recommended to use environment variable management tools or secrets management services to inject these values into the application environment, especially in production settings.

## Integration with Other Modules

Other modules within the `pilot` project that require database access should import the configuration variables from `config.py`. This ensures consistency across the application and centralizes the database configuration management.
