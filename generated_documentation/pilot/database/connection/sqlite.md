# `sqlite.py` Module

## Overview

The `sqlite.py` module is part of the `pilot` project, located within the `database/connection` subdirectory. This module is responsible for providing an interface to create and access a SQLite database instance using the `peewee` ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library. The database name is configured externally and imported from a configuration module.

## Dependencies

- `peewee`: A lightweight ORM library for Python that provides tools to interact with databases in an object-oriented manner.
- `database.config`: A configuration module that contains the database settings, including the database name (`DB_NAME`).

## Functions

### `get_sqlite_database`

#### Description

The `get_sqlite_database` function is the sole function defined in this module. It serves as a factory function that creates and returns a new instance of `SqliteDatabase` using the database name specified by the `DB_NAME` variable from the `database.config` module.

#### Syntax

```python
def get_sqlite_database()
```

#### Parameters

This function does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns

- `SqliteDatabase`: An instance of `SqliteDatabase` that represents the SQLite database connection.

#### Usage

The function is typically called by other parts of the project that require a connection to the SQLite database. The returned `SqliteDatabase` instance can be used to interact with the database, such as defining models, executing queries, and performing database operations.

#### Example

```python
from database.connection.sqlite import get_sqlite_database

# Obtain a SQLite database instance
db = get_sqlite_database()

# Use `db` to interact with the database
```

## Integration with Peewee ORM

The `SqliteDatabase` instance created by this module is designed to work seamlessly with the `peewee` ORM. Models representing tables in the SQLite database can be defined by subclassing `peewee.Model` and setting the `database` attribute to the instance returned by `get_sqlite_database`.

## Configuration

The database name used by the `get_sqlite_database` function is not hardcoded within the module. Instead, it is imported from the `database.config` module, which allows for easy modification of the database name without altering the `sqlite.py` module's code.

## File Location

The `sqlite.py` module is located at the following path within the project:

```
/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/database/connection/sqlite.py
```

This location indicates that the module is part of the `pilot` application's database connection handling mechanism, specifically for SQLite databases.
