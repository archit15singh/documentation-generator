# Dev_continue_development.py Technical Documentation

## Overview
The `Dev_continue_development.py` script is designed to test the user experience (UX) of continuing development on an existing project within a simulated environment. It leverages the pytest framework for testing and uses mock objects to simulate user input and system responses.

## Dependencies
- pytest: A testing framework that supports the creation and execution of test cases in Python.
- unittest.mock: A library for testing in Python that allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects.
- AgentConvo: A custom helper class that manages conversations with the agent.
- Developer: A custom helper class that represents a developer agent.
- utils: A module containing utility functions for creating projects and handling command-line interface (CLI) operations.
- MockQuestionary: A custom mock class that simulates user input for questionary prompts.

## Test Decorators
- `@pytest.mark.ux_test`: Marks the test as a user experience test, which can be used to selectively run UX-related tests.
- `@patch`: Used to replace the actual functions with mock objects for the duration of the test. The following functions are patched:
  - `utils.questionary.get_saved_user_input`
  - `helpers.cli.get_saved_command_run`
  - `helpers.AgentConvo.get_saved_development_step`
  - `helpers.AgentConvo.save_development_step`

## Test Function: test_continue_development
The `test_continue_development` function is the main test case within this script. It simulates the scenario where a developer continues development on a project.

### Mock Objects
- `mock_4`: Mocks the `helpers.AgentConvo.save_development_step` function.
- `mock_3`: Mocks the `helpers.AgentConvo.get_saved_development_step` function.
- `mock_2`: Mocks the `helpers.cli.get_saved_command_run` function.
- `mock_1`: Mocks the `utils.questionary.get_saved_user_input` function.

### Test Setup (Given)
- A project is created with the name 'continue_development' and type 'hello_world_server' using the `create_project` utility function.
- A `Developer` object is instantiated with the created project.
- The project's developer attribute is set to the instantiated `Developer` object.
- An `AgentConvo` object is instantiated with the `Developer` object.
- The `load_branch` method of the `AgentConvo` object is overridden with a lambda function that does nothing (simulating no action on loading a branch).
- The `run_command` attribute of the `Developer` object is set to 'node server.js', simulating the command that the developer would run.

### Test Execution (When)
- The test simulates user input by creating a `MockQuestionary` object with predefined responses ['r', 'continue'].
- The `with patch` context manager is used to replace the `utils.questionary.questionary` function with the `mock_questionary` object for the duration of the block.
- The `continue_development` method of the `Developer` object is called with the `AgentConvo` object, a branch name, and a development goal.
- A print statement indicates the end of the "continue_development" scenario.

### Test Teardown
- The `terminate_running_processes` function from the `helpers.cli` module is called to clean up any running processes that may have been started during the test.

## Usage
This test is executed as part of a test suite using the pytest framework. It is used to verify that the continue development workflow functions as expected within the project. The test ensures that when a developer chooses to continue development by typing "r", the system correctly calls the `run_command_until_success()` method and proceeds with the development process.

## Notes
- The script contains a commented-out line that would execute an npm install command with a timeout. This line can be uncommented and used if the test environment requires the installation of npm packages.
- There are instructions to uncomment certain lines and indent the remaining lines when debugging without console input. This is to facilitate testing without the need for actual user interaction with the console.
