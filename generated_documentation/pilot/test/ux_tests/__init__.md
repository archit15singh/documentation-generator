# UX Tests Module (`__init__.py`)

## Overview

The `__init__.py` file within the `ux_tests` directory of the `pilot/test` module serves as an entry point for running user experience (UX) tests related to command-line interface (CLI) operations. It defines a collection of tests that can be executed to validate the behavior of CLI commands and development workflows.

## Functions

### `run_test`

#### Description

The `run_test` function is the primary interface for executing a specified UX test. It takes a test name and a set of arguments, then runs the corresponding test function if it exists.

#### Parameters

- `test_name` (`str`): A string representing the name of the test to be executed.
- `args`: A variable representing the arguments to be passed to the test function. The type of `args` is not explicitly defined in the function signature, which implies flexibility in the kind of arguments that can be passed.

#### Behavior

1. The function begins by printing a message to the console indicating the start of the UX test specified by `test_name`.
2. It then defines a dictionary `tests` that maps test names (as strings) to their respective test functions. Currently, the following test functions are mapped:
   - `'cli_execute_command'`: Mapped to the `cli_execute_command` function, which likely tests the execution of CLI commands.
   - `'continue_development'`: Mapped to the `test_continue_development` function, which likely tests the workflow for continuing development on a project.
   - The commented-out line suggests that there was previously a test called `'run_command_until_success'` that has been disabled or removed from the current set of tests.
3. The function checks if the provided `test_name` exists within the `tests` dictionary.
   - If the `test_name` is found, the function calls `use_args(args)` to handle the arguments passed to the test. The specifics of how `use_args` processes the arguments are not detailed here but it is likely that it sets up the necessary environment or context for the test.
   - It then executes the test function associated with `test_name` by calling it and returns its result.
   - If the `test_name` is not found, the function prints a message indicating that the specified UX test was not found.

#### Return Value

- The return value of the `run_test` function is the result of the test function executed. The type of the return value is not specified and depends on the individual test function's implementation.

## Usage

The `run_test` function is designed to be called with a specific test name and the required arguments for that test. It is used within the project to run UX tests as part of the development process, quality assurance, or automated testing suites.

## Comments

- The commented-out import and test entry for `'run_command_until_success'` suggest that the codebase may be undergoing refactoring or that certain tests are being phased out or replaced.
- The lack of explicit typing for the `args` parameter in the `run_test` function signature indicates that the function is designed to accept a flexible set of arguments, which may vary depending on the test being executed.
- The `use_args` function is utilized without context, implying that there is a dependency on an external utility function that is responsible for handling the arguments provided to the tests.

## Example

To run the `cli_execute_command` UX test with a set of arguments, one would call the `run_test` function as follows:

```python
run_test('cli_execute_command', {'arg1': 'value1', 'arg2': 'value2'})
```

This would trigger the `cli_execute_command` test function with the provided arguments.
