# `test_file_snapshot.py` Technical Documentation

## Overview

The `test_file_snapshot.py` file is a test module that uses the pytest framework to validate the functionality of the `FileSnapshot` model and its interaction with the database. It includes tests for creating tables and storing file snapshots with various content types.

## Dependencies

- `base64`: Used for decoding base64 encoded data.
- `peewee`: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library used to interact with databases.
- `pytest`: A testing framework for Python.
- `database.config`: A module containing configuration variables for the database connection.
- `database.database`: A module containing the definition of the database tables.
- `database.models`: A package containing ORM models for different entities such as `User`, `App`, `FileSnapshot`, `File`, and `DevelopmentSteps`.

## Constants

- `EMPTY_PNG`: A constant that holds the binary content of a base64-decoded empty PNG image.

## Fixtures

### `database` Fixture

- **Purpose**: Sets up a new, empty, initialized test database for each test function.
- **Database Types**: Supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
- **Behavior**:
  - For SQLite, it creates an in-memory database.
  - For PostgreSQL, it expects an existing, empty database.
- **Implementation**:
  - Determines the database type from the `DATABASE_TYPE` configuration variable.
  - Binds the database instance to the tables defined in `TABLES`.
  - Creates all the tables before yielding the database to the test.
  - Rolls back any changes after the test by raising a custom `PostgresRollback` exception.
  - Drops all the tables after the test is completed or fails.

## Test Functions

### `test_create_tables`

- **Purpose**: Verifies that all the tables for the models are created in the database.
- **Implementation**:
  - Retrieves the list of tables from the database.
  - Compares the retrieved list with the expected list of table names derived from `TABLES`.
  - Asserts that both sets are equal.

### `test_file_snapshot`

- **Purpose**: Tests the creation and retrieval of `FileSnapshot` instances with various types of content.
- **Parameterization**: Uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` to run the test with different content types:
  - ASCII text
  - Non-ASCII text with special characters
  - Text with a null byte
  - Binary content of an empty PNG image
- **Implementation**:
  - Creates a `User`, `App`, `DevelopmentSteps`, and `File` instance.
  - Creates a `FileSnapshot` instance with the provided content.
  - Retrieves the `FileSnapshot` from the database using its ID.
  - Asserts that the content retrieved from the database matches the expected content.

## Usage

This test module is executed as part of the project's test suite. It is used to ensure that the `FileSnapshot` model and related database operations work as expected. The tests are automatically run by the pytest framework, which can be triggered via a command-line interface or a continuous integration system.

To run the tests in this module, one would typically execute a command like `pytest test_file_snapshot.py` from the command line within the project's test environment.
