# MockQuestionary Class

## Overview

The `MockQuestionary` class is a mock implementation of an interactive command-line interface for collecting user input, typically used for testing purposes. It simulates the behavior of a questionnaire by providing predefined answers to the questions it asks.

## Attributes

- `answers`: An iterator over a list of predefined answers that the mock questionary will provide when prompted.
- `state`: A string representing the current state of the questionary. It determines the behavior of the `unsafe_ask` method when it is called.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, answers=None, initial_state='project_description')`

The constructor initializes the `MockQuestionary` instance.

#### Parameters

- `answers` (optional): A list of strings representing the answers to be provided by the mock questionary. If not provided, it defaults to an empty list.
- `initial_state` (optional): A string representing the initial state of the questionary. It defaults to `'project_description'`.

#### Behavior

- Initializes the `answers` attribute as an iterator over the provided list of answers or an empty list if none is provided.
- Sets the `state` attribute to the provided `initial_state` or to `'project_description'` by default.

### `text(self, question: str, style=None)`

Simulates asking a text question to the user.

#### Parameters

- `question`: A string representing the question to be asked.
- `style` (optional): An unused parameter in this mock implementation, typically used to specify the styling of the question in a real questionary.

#### Behavior

- Prints the question to the console prefixed with `'AI: '`.
- Updates the `state` attribute based on the content of the question:
  - If the question starts with `'User Story'`, the state is set to `'user_stories'`.
  - If the question ends with `'write "DONE"'`, the state is set to `'DONE'`.
- Returns the `MockQuestionary` instance itself to allow method chaining.

### `ask(self)`

A wrapper method that calls the `unsafe_ask` method.

#### Behavior

- Returns the result of the `unsafe_ask` method.

### `unsafe_ask(self)`

Provides a mock answer based on the current state of the questionary.

#### Behavior

- If the `state` is `'user_stories'`, it sets the answer to an empty string.
- If the `state` is `'DONE'`, it sets the answer to `'DONE'`.
- Otherwise, it retrieves the next answer from the `answers` iterator or defaults to an empty string if there are no more answers.
- Prints the answer to the console prefixed with `'User: '`.
- Returns the answer.

## Nested Class: Style

### Overview

The `Style` nested class is a placeholder for styling options in the mock implementation. It does not implement any functionality and is present to maintain compatibility with the interface of a real questionary.

### `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)`

The constructor for the `Style` class, which accepts any number of positional and keyword arguments but does not perform any operations with them.

## Usage in Project

The `MockQuestionary` class is used in automated tests to simulate user input without requiring actual user interaction. It allows tests to verify the behavior of code that depends on user input by providing predetermined responses. The class can be instantiated with a list of answers and an initial state, and then used in place of a real questionary object within the test environment.
