# `test_utils.py` Module

## Overview

The `test_utils.py` module provides utility functions for testing within the `pilot` test suite. It includes functions that mock system behaviors and assertions specific to the needs of the test cases.

## Functions

### `mock_terminal_size`

#### Description

The `mock_terminal_size` function creates a mock object that simulates the behavior of a terminal window size. This mock object can be used in test cases where functions or methods depend on terminal dimensions.

#### Usage

The function is called without any arguments and returns a mock object with a predefined `columns` attribute.

#### Implementation Details

- A `Mock` object from the `unittest.mock` module is instantiated.
- The `columns` attribute of the mock object is set to `80`. This value represents the width of the terminal in columns and can be adjusted to simulate different terminal widths.
- The mock object is then returned for use in test cases.

### `assert_non_empty_string`

#### Description

The `assert_non_empty_string` function is an assertion helper that ensures a given value is a non-empty string. It is used in test cases to validate that string-based inputs or outputs conform to expected conditions.

#### Usage

The function is called with a single argument, `value`, which is the string to be tested.

#### Implementation Details

- The function first asserts that the `value` is an instance of `str`, ensuring that the type is a string.
- It then asserts that the length of `value` is greater than `0`, ensuring that the string is not empty.
- If either of the assertions fails, the test case using this function will fail, indicating a problem with the tested functionality.

## Example

Here is an example of how these utility functions might be used in a test case:

```python
from .test_utils import mock_terminal_size, assert_non_empty_string

def test_terminal_function():
    # Mock the terminal size for a function that depends on it
    terminal_size = mock_terminal_size()
    
    # Use the mock terminal size in the function under test
    result = some_function_that_uses_terminal_size(terminal_size)
    
    # Assert that the result is a non-empty string
    assert_non_empty_string(result)
```

In this example, `some_function_that_uses_terminal_size` would be a function within the project that requires knowledge of the terminal size to work correctly. The `test_terminal_function` test case uses `mock_terminal_size` to simulate the terminal size and `assert_non_empty_string` to validate the output of the function.
```
