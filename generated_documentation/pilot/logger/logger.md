# Logger Module Documentation

## Overview

The `logger.py` module within the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/logger/` directory is responsible for setting up a logging system for the project. It provides a mechanism to create log messages with a custom format and to filter out sensitive information from the logs. The module also determines the logging level based on an environment variable.

## Functions

### setup_logger

#### Description

The `setup_logger` function initializes and configures a logger with a specific format, file handler, and logging level. It also applies a filter to the log records to prevent sensitive information from being logged.

#### Parameters

This function does not accept any parameters.

#### Returns

- `logger`: A configured `logging.Logger` instance.

#### Details

1. **Log Format Configuration**: A custom log format is defined as a string, which includes the timestamp, filename, line number, function name, log level, and log message.
2. **File Handler Creation**: A `logging.FileHandler` is created to write logs to a file named `debug.log`, located in the same directory as the `logger.py` file. The file is opened in write mode (`'w'`) with UTF-8 encoding.
3. **Formatter Application**: A `logging.Formatter` is instantiated with the custom log format and applied to the file handler.
4. **Sensitive Fields Filter**: The `filter_sensitive_fields` function is added as a filter to the file handler to sanitize any sensitive information from the logs.
5. **Logger Configuration**: A root logger is obtained using `logging.getLogger()`, and the file handler is added to it. The logging level is set to `DEBUG` if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set to `'true'`, otherwise, it defaults to `INFO`.

### filter_sensitive_fields

#### Description

The `filter_sensitive_fields` function is a filter for log records that obfuscates sensitive information defined in the `sensitive_fields` list.

#### Parameters

- `record`: A `logging.LogRecord` object that represents the event being logged.

#### Returns

- `True`: Always returns `True` to indicate that the record should be processed.

#### Details

1. **Dictionary Arguments**: If the `record.args` is a dictionary, it creates a copy and replaces the values of keys that match any of the `sensitive_fields` with asterisks (`'*****'`).
2. **Tuple Arguments**: If the `record.args` is a tuple, it converts it to a list and replaces any elements that match the `sensitive_fields` with asterisks.
3. **ANSI Escape Sequences**: If `record.msg` is a string, it uses a regular expression to remove ANSI escape sequences, which are used for formatting terminal output (e.g., colors, bold text).

## Variables

### sensitive_fields

A list of strings representing the keys of sensitive fields that should be filtered out from the logs. The default sensitive fields are `'--api-key'` and `'password'`.

## Usage

At the end of the module, the `setup_logger` function is called, and the configured logger is stored in the `logger` variable. This logger can then be imported and used throughout the project to log messages while automatically filtering out sensitive information and writing logs to the `debug.log` file with the specified format.

## Example

```python
from logger import logger

logger.info("This is an informational message.")
logger.debug("This is a debug message with an API key.", {'--api-key': '12345'})
```

In the example above, the API key would be replaced with asterisks in the log file.
