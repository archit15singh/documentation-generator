# `__init__.py` in `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/templates`

## Overview

This file is part of a project documentation generator and is responsible for applying a project template to a new project. It contains the logic to select and instantiate a project template based on the project's requirements.

## Imports

- `os`: Standard library module for interacting with the operating system.
- `typing`: Module for supporting type hints.
- `TYPE_CHECKING`: Special constant used for type hints that should not be evaluated at runtime.
- `Optional`: Type hint that indicates an optional return value.
- `color_green_bold`: Function from `utils.style` module to format text in bold green color.
- `logger`: Custom logger from `logger.logger` module for logging messages.
- `trace_code_event`: Function from `utils.exit` module to trace code execution events.
- `NODE_EXPRESS_MONGOOSE`: Constant representing the Node.js, Express, and Mongoose template.
- `Renderer`: Class from `.render` module responsible for rendering files from templates.
- `Project`: Type hint for a `Project` class (imported only for type checking purposes).

## Constants

- `PROJECT_TEMPLATES`: A dictionary mapping template names to their corresponding template data.

## Functions

### `apply_project_template(project: "Project") -> Optional[str]`

#### Parameters

- `project`: An instance of the `Project` class representing the project to which the template will be applied.

#### Returns

- `Optional[str]`: A string summary of the applied template, or `None` if no template was applied.

#### Description

This function applies a selected project template to a new project instance. It performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the template name from the `project` instance.
2. Checks if the template name is valid and exists in the `PROJECT_TEMPLATES` dictionary. If not, logs a warning and returns `None`.
3. Initializes the `Renderer` with the path to the template files.
4. Renders the template files with the project's name and description as context.
5. Iterates over the rendered files, creating directories as needed, and writes the file contents to the project's root path.
6. Adds file information to the `project_files` list, ensuring paths are compatible with the rest of the system.
7. Logs the start of the template application process and prints a message to the console.
8. Saves a snapshot of the created files to the project's last development step checkpoint.
9. If an `install_hook` is provided by the template, it attempts to run it, logging any errors encountered.
10. Traces the code event for applying a project template.
11. Constructs a summary of the applied template, including a description of the code so far.

#### Usage

This function is typically called when a new project is created and a specific template needs to be applied to set up the initial structure and files of the project. The function is used internally within the project documentation generator to automate the setup process based on the selected template.

#### Error Handling

- If the template name is not found or is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function returns `None`.
- If an error occurs during the execution of the `install_hook`, it is logged along with the exception information.

#### Side Effects

- The project's file system is modified by creating new directories and files according to the template.
- A snapshot of the project files is saved to a checkpoint.
- A code event is traced for analytics or debugging purposes.

#### Notes

- The `TYPE_CHECKING` constant is used to prevent the import of the `Project` class at runtime, which is only needed for type annotations.
- The `trace_code_event` function is used to log the event of applying a project template for monitoring or debugging purposes.
- The `color_green_bold` function is used to enhance the visibility of the console output when applying the template.
