# Node + Express + MongoDB Template

## Overview

The `node_express_mongoose.py` file is part of a project scaffolding tool that provides a template for creating a web application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This template includes session-based authentication, EJS views, and Bootstrap 5 for styling. It is designed to streamline the initial setup process for developers by providing a pre-configured application structure.

## Template Structure

The template is defined as a Python dictionary named `NODE_EXPRESS_MONGOOSE` with the following keys:

- `path`: A string that specifies the directory path where the template should be applied within the project.
- `description`: A detailed string that outlines the features and components included in the template.
- `summary`: A string that provides a concise list of the main elements and configurations set up by the template.
- `install_hook`: A reference to a function that is executed to complete the project scaffolding setup.

## Description Details

The `description` key provides an in-depth explanation of what the template offers:

- Initial setup for a Node.js application using the Express.js framework.
- A User model defined using the Mongoose Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, with fields for username and password. The username field is enforced to be unique, and passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- Session-based authentication implemented in `routes/authRoutes.js`, utilizing `express-session` for managing user sessions.
- Middleware for authentication to secure routes that require a user to be logged in.
- The use of the EJS templating engine to render HTML views, with partials for common elements like the head, header, and footer of the page. Bootstrap 5.x is included for CSS and JavaScript components.
- Predefined routes and corresponding EJS views for user login, registration, and the home page.
- Configuration management using the `dotenv` package, with an example `.env.example` file provided. Developers need to create their own `.env` file with appropriate values for their environment.

## Summary

The `summary` key concatenates a list of bullet points into a single string that briefly outlines the key features of the template:

- Node + Express initial setup
- User model with unique usernames and hashed passwords
- Session-based authentication using bcrypt and express-session
- Authentication middleware for route protection
- EJS view engine with HTML partials and Bootstrap 5 integration
- Predefined routes and views for login, registration, and home page
- Environment configuration via dotenv with an example file

## Install Hook

The `install_hook` key references the `install_hook` function defined within the file. This function is intended to be called to complete the setup of the project scaffolding. It takes a `project` object as a parameter and executes the `npm install` command within the project's context by calling the `execute_command` function from the `helpers.cli` module. This installs the necessary Node.js packages as specified in the project's `package.json` file.

## Usage

To use this template within a project, the scaffolding tool would typically import this file and access the `NODE_EXPRESS_MONGOOSE` dictionary. It would then apply the template to the specified `path` and run the `install_hook` to install dependencies and finalize the setup. The developer would then need to create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` and customize the application as needed.
