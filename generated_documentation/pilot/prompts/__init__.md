# `__init__.py` in `prompts` Module

## Overview

The `__init__.py` file within the `prompts` directory of the `pilot` module serves as an initializer for the `prompts` package. This file can be used to expose specific classes, functions, or variables from the package, making them directly accessible when the package is imported elsewhere in the project.

## Usage

When the `prompts` package is imported, Python will execute the `__init__.py` file. The contents of this file determine which components of the `prompts` package are available to the importer. This can include importing classes or functions from submodules within the `prompts` package, initializing package-level variables, or running any startup code required by the package.

## Structure

The structure of the `__init__.py` file can vary depending on the needs of the `prompts` package. Below is a description of potential contents:

### Import Statements

The file may contain import statements to bring in classes, functions, or variables from other modules within the `prompts` package. For example:

```python
from .question_prompt import QuestionPrompt
from .input_validation import validate_input
```

These statements make `QuestionPrompt` and `validate_input` directly accessible via `from prompts import QuestionPrompt, validate_input`.

### Initialization Code

If the `prompts` package requires any initialization logic to be run when it is first imported, this code would be placed in the `__init__.py` file. This could include setting up logging, initializing package-level data structures, or other preparatory tasks.

### Subpackage Importing

If the `prompts` package contains subpackages, the `__init__.py` file may handle importing these to make them available as part of the `prompts` namespace. For example:

```python
from . import subprompt
```

This allows users to access the `subprompt` package through the `prompts` namespace, like so: `import prompts.subprompt`.

### __all__ Variable

The `__init__.py` file may define an `__all__` variable, which is a list of strings defining what symbols the package will export when `from prompts import *` is used:

```python
__all__ = ['QuestionPrompt', 'validate_input']
```

This restricts the wildcard import to only include the specified items.

## Best Practices

- Keep the `__init__.py` file as simple as possible, only including necessary imports and initialization code.
- Use absolute imports to avoid confusion and make the code more readable.
- Define the `__all__` variable if the package is large or if there is a need to limit the exported symbols.

## Conclusion

The `__init__.py` file in the `prompts` package plays a crucial role in defining the package's interface and initialization behavior. It should be carefully maintained to ensure that the package's users have a clear and consistent experience when importing and using its components.
