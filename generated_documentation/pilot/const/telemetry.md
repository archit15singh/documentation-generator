# Telemetry Constants

The `telemetry.py` file within the `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/pilot/const` directory defines a set of constants that are used to monitor and control the behavior of the system with respect to data transmission, request handling, and task execution. These constants are critical for ensuring the system operates within predefined performance thresholds.

## Constants

### `LARGE_REQUEST_THRESHOLD`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Value**: `50000`
- **Description**: This constant represents the threshold for the number of tokens that define a large request. A token typically corresponds to a unit of data or a character in a request payload. When a request contains more than `50000` tokens, it is considered a large request. This threshold is used to trigger specific handling procedures for large requests, such as additional logging, alerting, or special processing to manage the potential impact on system resources.

### `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Value**: `300`
- **Description**: This constant defines the time limit in seconds for a request to be considered slow. If a request takes longer than `300` seconds to complete, it exceeds the `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD`. The system may use this information to identify performance bottlenecks, log warnings, or take corrective actions to improve response times. Monitoring slow requests helps maintain the overall responsiveness of the system.

### `LOOP_THRESHOLD`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Value**: `20`
- **Description**: The `LOOP_THRESHOLD` constant specifies the number of steps in a task that qualifies it as a loop. In this context, a loop refers to a repetitive sequence of operations or iterations within a task. If a task involves more than `20` steps, it is flagged as a loop. This threshold is important for detecting potential infinite loops or unnecessarily long iterative processes that could degrade system performance or lead to resource exhaustion.

## Usage

The constants defined in `telemetry.py` are typically imported and used by other modules within the project that are responsible for monitoring system performance, handling requests, and managing task execution. For example:

- A request handling module might import `LARGE_REQUEST_THRESHOLD` to decide whether to split a large request into smaller chunks or to allocate more resources for processing.
- A performance monitoring module could use `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD` to log requests that exceed the acceptable response time, triggering alerts or initiating performance analysis.
- A task management component may check against `LOOP_THRESHOLD` to prevent tasks from running indefinitely or to optimize the execution of tasks with a high number of iterations.

By centralizing these constants in the `telemetry.py` file, the project ensures that there is a single source of truth for these thresholds, facilitating maintainability and consistency across the system.
