# Technical Documentation for `function_calls.py`

## Overview

The `function_calls.py` file contains a collection of function definitions and data structures that are used to model various aspects of a software development process. These include processing user stories, tasks, operating system technologies, running commands, and handling files. Additionally, the file defines structures for development steps, commands, and testing procedures.
