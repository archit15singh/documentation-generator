# LLM Constants Module

## Overview

The `llm.py` module is part of the `pilot` package within the `const` subdirectory. It defines a set of constants that are used across the project to manage interactions with a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model and API communication. These constants are crucial for ensuring that the application behaves consistently with respect to token limits, response handling, and network timeouts.

## Constants

### `MAX_GPT_MODEL_TOKENS`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of tokens that the GPT model can process in a single request.
- **Default Value**: 8192
- **Retrieval Method**: The value is retrieved from the environment variable `MAX_TOKENS`. If `MAX_TOKENS` is not set, the default value of 8192 is used.
- **Usage**: This constant is used to prevent the application from sending requests to the GPT model that exceed the model's token processing capacity.

### `MIN_TOKENS_FOR_GPT_RESPONSE`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Description**: Defines the minimum number of tokens expected in a response from the GPT model.
- **Value**: 600
- **Usage**: This constant is used to validate the length of the response received from the GPT model. It ensures that the response is sufficiently detailed and meets a minimum length requirement.

### `MAX_QUESTIONS`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Description**: Sets the maximum number of questions that can be handled in a single session or interaction.
- **Value**: 5
- **Usage**: This constant is used to limit the number of questions processed, thereby controlling the scope of a session and preventing excessive use of resources.

### `END_RESPONSE`

- **Type**: String
- **Description**: Represents a specific keyword or phrase that indicates the end of a response from the GPT model.
- **Value**: "EVERYTHING_CLEAR"
- **Usage**: This constant is used as a marker to determine when the GPT model has completed its response, allowing the application to proceed with subsequent actions or to close the session.

### `API_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Description**: Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the application will wait while trying to connect to the API before timing out.
- **Value**: 30 seconds
- **Usage**: This constant is used to set the connection timeout parameter in network requests to the API. It helps in handling scenarios where the API is unresponsive or slow to connect.

### `API_READ_TIMEOUT`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Description**: Defines the amount of time in seconds that the application will wait to receive a response from the API after the request has been sent.
- **Value**: 300 seconds
- **Usage**: This constant is used to set the read timeout parameter in network requests to the API. It ensures that the application does not indefinitely wait for a response and can handle situations where the API is slow to respond.

## Module Usage

The constants defined in the `llm.py` module are used throughout the project to maintain consistent behavior when interacting with the GPT model and handling API requests and responses. By centralizing these values, the module allows for easy adjustments to the application's configuration and ensures that all parts of the project adhere to the same constraints and timeouts.
