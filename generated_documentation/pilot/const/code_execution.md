# Code Execution Constants

The `code_execution.py` file defines a set of constants that are used to control the behavior of code execution within the project. These constants are used to set limits and thresholds for the execution of commands or scripts by the system. Below is a detailed description of each constant and its usage:

## Constants

### `MAX_COMMAND_DEBUG_TRIES`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default Value**: `3`
- **Description**: This constant specifies the maximum number of attempts the system will make to execute a command in debug mode. If a command fails to execute successfully, the system will retry execution up to this number of times before giving up and reporting an error. This is useful for transient issues that may resolve upon subsequent attempts.

### `MAX_RECURSION_LAYER`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default Value**: `3`
- **Description**: This constant defines the maximum depth of recursion allowed when executing nested commands or scripts. It is a safeguard to prevent infinite recursion, which can lead to stack overflow errors and potential crashes. If the recursion depth exceeds this limit, the system will halt further recursive calls and raise an exception.

### `MIN_COMMAND_RUN_TIME`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default Value**: `2000` (milliseconds)
- **Description**: This constant sets the minimum runtime for a command in milliseconds. It is used to ensure that commands have a reasonable amount of time to start up and perform their intended actions. If a command completes in less time than this threshold, it may be indicative of a failure or misconfiguration, and the system may take corrective action or log a warning.

### `MAX_COMMAND_RUN_TIME`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default Value**: `60000` (milliseconds)
- **Description**: This constant establishes the maximum allowable runtime for a command in milliseconds. It acts as a timeout to prevent commands from running indefinitely, which could tie up system resources or cause hangs. If a command exceeds this duration, the system will forcibly terminate the command and may log an error or take other defined actions.

### `MAX_COMMAND_OUTPUT_LENGTH`

- **Type**: Integer
- **Default Value**: `50000` (characters)
- **Description**: This constant limits the length of the output that a command can produce. It is used to prevent excessive memory consumption and potential performance issues that could arise from processing or storing very large outputs. If the output from a command exceeds this number of characters, the system will truncate the output and may log a warning or error.

## Usage

These constants are typically used by the command execution module of the project. The module will reference these constants to determine how to handle the execution of commands, including how many times to retry failed commands (`MAX_COMMAND_DEBUG_TRIES`), how deep to allow recursive command execution (`MAX_RECURSION_LAYER`), and how to manage command execution time (`MIN_COMMAND_RUN_TIME` and `MAX_COMMAND_RUN_TIME`). Additionally, the output from commands is monitored and potentially truncated based on the `MAX_COMMAND_OUTPUT_LENGTH` constant.

The constants provide a configurable way to set execution policies without hardcoding values within the command execution logic. This allows for easier adjustments and tuning of the system's behavior as requirements change or as the system is deployed in different environments with varying constraints.
