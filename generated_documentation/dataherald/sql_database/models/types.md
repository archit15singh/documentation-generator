# Types Module Documentation

## Overview

The `types.py` module within the `dataherald/sql_database/models` directory defines several Pydantic models and utility classes that are used to represent and manage credentials and settings for various services such as API access, file storage, SSH connections, and database connections. It also includes encryption and validation logic to ensure the security and integrity of sensitive information.

## Classes

### LLMCredentials

`LLMCredentials` is a subclass of `BaseSettings` from the `pydantic` library. It is used to manage credentials for an unspecified service, likely related to an organization's API access.

#### Attributes

- `organization_id`: Optional string representing the organization's identifier.
- `api_key`: Optional string representing the API key for the organization.

#### Validators

- A class-level validator is defined for the `api_key` and `organization_id` attributes. It encrypts the values using `FernetEncrypt` unless they are already encrypted.

#### Methods

- `__getitem__`: Allows access to attribute values using dictionary-like key access.

### FileStorage

`FileStorage` is a subclass of `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library. It represents the configuration needed to access file storage services.

#### Attributes

- `name`: String representing the name of the file storage.
- `access_key_id`: String representing the access key ID for the file storage service.
- `secret_access_key`: String representing the secret access key for the file storage service.
- `region`: Optional string representing the region where the file storage service is located.
- `bucket`: String representing the bucket name in the file storage service.

#### Config

- Ignores any extra attributes that are not explicitly defined in the model.

#### Validators

- A class-level validator is defined for the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` attributes. It encrypts the values using `FernetEncrypt` unless they are already encrypted.

#### Methods

- `__getitem__`: Allows access to attribute values using dictionary-like key access.

### SSHSettings

`SSHSettings` is a subclass of `BaseSettings` from the `pydantic` library. It holds configuration for SSH connections.

#### Attributes

- `host`: Optional string representing the SSH server host.
- `username`: Optional string representing the SSH username.
- `password`: Optional string representing the SSH password.
- `port`: String representing the SSH port, defaulting to "22".
- `private_key_password`: Optional string representing the password for the SSH private key.

#### Config

- Ignores any extra attributes that are not explicitly defined in the model.

#### Validators

- A class-level validator is defined for the `password` and `private_key_password` attributes. It encrypts the values using `FernetEncrypt` unless they are already encrypted.

#### Methods

- `__getitem__`: Allows access to attribute values using dictionary-like key access.

### InvalidURIFormatError

`InvalidURIFormatError` is a custom exception class that is raised when a URI does not match the expected format.

### DatabaseConnection

`DatabaseConnection` is a subclass of `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` library. It represents the configuration needed to establish a connection to a database.

#### Attributes

- `id`: Optional string representing the unique identifier for the database connection.
- `alias`: String representing an alias for the database connection.
- `use_ssh`: Boolean indicating whether SSH should be used for the connection, defaulting to `False`.
- `connection_uri`: Optional string representing the URI used to connect to the database.
- `path_to_credentials_file`: Optional string representing the file path to additional credentials.
- `llm_api_key`: Optional string representing an API key for LLM services.
- `ssh_settings`: Optional `SSHSettings` object representing SSH connection settings.
- `file_storage`: Optional `FileStorage` object representing file storage settings.
- `metadata`: Optional dictionary containing additional metadata.
- `created_at`: `datetime` object representing the creation time of the database connection, defaulting to the current time.

#### Class Methods

- `validate_uri`: Validates the format of the `connection_uri` using a regular expression pattern.

#### Validators

- A class-level validator is defined for the `connection_uri` attribute. It encrypts the value using `FernetEncrypt` unless it is already encrypted and validates the URI format.
- A class-level validator is defined for the `llm_api_key` attribute. It encrypts the value using `FernetEncrypt` unless it is already encrypted.

#### Methods

- `decrypt_api_key`: Decrypts the `llm_api_key` if it is set and not empty, otherwise retrieves the API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage

The models defined in this module are likely used throughout the project to manage and securely store configuration settings for various services. The encryption and decryption of sensitive information ensure that credentials are not stored or transmitted in plain text. The validators provide additional checks to ensure that the data conforms to expected formats and standards.

The `__getitem__` methods in each model allow for easy access to the model's attributes, making it convenient to retrieve settings in a dictionary-like manner. The custom exception `InvalidURIFormatError` is used to provide clear error messages when a URI does not meet the required format, which is particularly important for establishing database connections.

Overall, this module plays a critical role in the security and configuration management aspects of the project.
