# Chroma Class

## Overview

The `Chroma` class is a subclass of `VectorStore` and provides an interface for interacting with a vector database using the `chromadb` library. It is designed to store, query, and manage collections of vectors, which are typically used for similarity search or other vector-based operations. The class includes methods for querying the database, adding records, deleting records, and managing collections.

## Initialization

### `__init__(self, system: System, persist_directory: str = "/app/chroma")`

The constructor initializes the `Chroma` class with the following parameters:

- `system`: An instance of the `System` class from the `dataherald.config` module, which contains configuration settings for the system.
- `persist_directory`: A string representing the file path to the directory where the `chromadb` persistent client will store its data. The default value is `/app/chroma`.

The constructor creates a `PersistentClient` from the `chromadb` library, which is used to interact with the vector database. The client is initialized with the specified `persist_directory`.

## Methods

### `query(self, query_texts: List[str], db_connection_id: str, collection: str, num_results: int) -> list`

Queries the specified collection for vectors similar to the provided `query_texts`. It takes the following parameters:

- `query_texts`: A list of strings representing the query vectors.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the database connection identifier.
- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection to query.
- `num_results`: An integer specifying the maximum number of results to return.

The method attempts to retrieve the target collection from the `chromadb` client. If the collection does not exist, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it performs the query and returns the results converted to the Pinecone object model using the `convert_to_pinecone_object_model` method.

### `add_records(self, golden_sqls: List[GoldenSQL], collection: str)`

Adds multiple records to the specified collection. It takes the following parameters:

- `golden_sqls`: A list of `GoldenSQL` objects, which contain the SQL queries and associated metadata.
- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection where the records will be added.

The method iterates over the `golden_sqls` list, extracting the necessary information and adding each record to the collection using the `add_record` method.

### `add_record(self, documents: str, db_connection_id: str, collection: str, metadata: Any, ids: List)`

Adds a single record to the specified collection. It takes the following parameters:

- `documents`: A string representing the document to be added.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the database connection identifier.
- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection where the record will be added.
- `metadata`: Any additional metadata associated with the document.
- `ids`: A list of identifiers for the document.

The method retrieves or creates the target collection and checks if the document already exists. If not, it adds the document along with its metadata and identifier to the collection.

### `delete_record(self, collection: str, id: str)`

Deletes a record from the specified collection. It takes the following parameters:

- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection.
- `id`: A string representing the identifier of the record to be deleted.

The method retrieves or creates the target collection and deletes the record with the specified identifier.

### `delete_collection(self, collection: str)`

Deletes the specified collection. It takes the following parameter:

- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection to be deleted.

This method overrides the `delete_collection` method from the `VectorStore` class.

### `create_collection(self, collection: str)`

Creates a new collection. It takes the following parameter:

- `collection`: A string representing the name of the collection to be created.

This method overrides the `create_collection` method from the `VectorStore` class.

### `convert_to_pinecone_object_model(self, chroma_results: dict) -> List`

Converts the results from a `chromadb` query to the Pinecone object model. It takes the following parameter:

- `chroma_results`: A dictionary containing the results from a `chromadb` query.

The method iterates over the results and constructs a list of dictionaries, each containing an identifier and a score, which are compatible with the Pinecone object model.

## Usage

The `Chroma` class is used within a project to interact with a vector database for storing and retrieving vector data. It provides a high-level API for performing operations such as querying for similar vectors, adding new vectors, and managing collections within the database. The class is designed to be used with the `chromadb` library and integrates with the Pinecone object model for compatibility with other components of the system.
