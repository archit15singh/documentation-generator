# VectorStore Module

## Overview

The `VectorStore` module is part of the `dataherald` package, specifically within the `vector_store` subpackage. It defines an abstract base class `VectorStore` that outlines the interface for various vector storage implementations. This module is designed to interact with collections of vectors, which are typically used in machine learning and data processing applications.

## Classes

### VectorStore

The `VectorStore` class is an abstract base class that inherits from `Component` and `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) from the `abc` module. It provides a template for creating concrete vector store implementations that can be integrated into the `dataherald` system.

#### Attributes

- `collections`: A list of strings representing the names of the collections managed by the vector store.

#### Methods

##### `__init__(self, system: System)`

The constructor initializes the vector store with a reference to the `System` object. This method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.

Parameters:
- `system`: An instance of the `System` class from the `dataherald.config` module.

##### `query(self, query_texts: List[str], db_connection_id: str, collection: str, num_results: int) -> list`

Abstract method for querying the vector store. It retrieves a list of results based on the provided query texts.

Parameters:
- `query_texts`: A list of strings containing the query texts.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the database connection identifier.
- `collection`: The name of the collection to query.
- `num_results`: The number of results to return.

Returns:
- A list of query results.

##### `create_collection(self, collection: str)`

Abstract method for creating a new collection within the vector store.

Parameters:
- `collection`: The name of the collection to create.

##### `add_records(self, golden_sqls: List[GoldenSQL], collection: str)`

Abstract method for adding multiple records to a specified collection.

Parameters:
- `golden_sqls`: A list of `GoldenSQL` objects to be added to the collection.
- `collection`: The name of the collection where the records will be added.

##### `add_record(self, documents: str, db_connection_id: str, collection: str, metadata: Any, ids: List = None)`

Abstract method for adding a single record to a specified collection.

Parameters:
- `documents`: A string representing the documents to be added.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the database connection identifier.
- `collection`: The name of the collection where the record will be added.
- `metadata`: Additional metadata associated with the record.
- `ids`: An optional list of identifiers for the record.

##### `delete_record(self, collection: str, id: str)`

Abstract method for deleting a record from a specified collection.

Parameters:
- `collection`: The name of the collection from which the record will be deleted.
- `id`: The identifier of the record to be deleted.

##### `delete_collection(self, collection: str)`

Abstract method for deleting an entire collection from the vector store.

Parameters:
- `collection`: The name of the collection to be deleted.

## Usage

The `VectorStore` class is not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for creating concrete subclasses that implement the abstract methods defined in the class. These implementations are responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of vector data in various backends, such as databases or file systems.

Concrete subclasses of `VectorStore` must implement all abstract methods to provide functionality for querying, adding, and deleting records and collections. Once implemented, these subclasses can be integrated into the `dataherald` system and used to manage vector data as part of the project's data processing and machine learning workflows.
