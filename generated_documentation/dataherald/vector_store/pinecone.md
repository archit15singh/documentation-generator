# Pinecone Vector Store Module

## Overview

The `Pinecone` class is a subclass of `VectorStore` and provides an interface for interacting with Pinecone, a vector database for building search, recommendation, and AI applications. It is designed to store, query, and manage embeddings of SQL queries and their metadata.

## Initialization

### `__init__(self, system: System)`

The constructor initializes the Pinecone client with the necessary API key and environment variables. It requires a `System` object to access the application's configuration and database.

- **Parameters:**
  - `system`: An instance of the `System` class containing configuration and database access.

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `PINECONE_API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with the Pinecone service.
  - `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: The environment setting for Pinecone.

- **Exceptions:**
  - Raises `ValueError` if either `PINECONE_API_KEY` or `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` is not set.

## Methods

### `query(self, query_texts: List[str], db_connection_id: str, collection: str, num_results: int) -> list`

Queries the Pinecone index for similar vectors to the provided query text and returns a list of matches.

- **Parameters:**
  - `query_texts`: A list of strings containing the query text.
  - `db_connection_id`: The database connection ID to filter results.
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to query.
  - `num_results`: The number of results to return.

- **Returns:**
  - A list of query results with metadata.

### `add_records(self, golden_sqls: List[GoldenSQL], collection: str)`

Adds multiple records to the Pinecone index.

- **Parameters:**
  - `golden_sqls`: A list of `GoldenSQL` objects containing the SQL queries and associated metadata.
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to add records to.

### `add_record(self, documents: str, db_connection_id: str, collection: str, metadata: Any, ids: List)`

Adds a single record to the Pinecone index.

- **Parameters:**
  - `documents`: The document text to be embedded and stored.
  - `db_connection_id`: The database connection ID associated with the document.
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to add the record to.
  - `metadata`: Additional metadata to store with the record.
  - `ids`: A list containing the ID of the record.

### `delete_record(self, collection: str, id: str)`

Deletes a record from the Pinecone index.

- **Parameters:**
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to delete the record from.
  - `id`: The ID of the record to delete.

### `delete_collection(self, collection: str)`

Deletes an entire Pinecone collection.

- **Parameters:**
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to delete.

### `create_collection(self, collection: str)`

Creates a new Pinecone collection with the specified name.

- **Parameters:**
  - `collection`: The name of the Pinecone collection to create.

## Usage

The `Pinecone` class is used within the project to manage the storage and retrieval of SQL query embeddings. It interacts with the Pinecone service to perform operations such as querying for similar embeddings, adding new embeddings, and managing collections and records within the Pinecone index.

The embeddings are generated using the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class, which utilizes the OpenAI API to convert text into vector representations. These embeddings are then stored in Pinecone along with metadata such as the tables used in the SQL query and the database connection ID.

The class methods are decorated with `@override` to indicate that they are overriding methods from the `VectorStore` base class. This ensures that the `Pinecone` class provides a consistent interface for vector storage operations within the project.
