# `config.py` Module Documentation

## Overview

The `config.py` module is part of the `dataherald` project and is responsible for managing configuration settings, abstract component instantiation, and system-wide component management. It defines classes for loading environment-specific settings, abstract component definitions, and a system class to manage component instances.

## Classes and Functions

### `Settings` Class

The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings` provided by the `pydantic` library. It is used to define and access configuration settings for the `dataherald` project.

#### Attributes

- `api_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the API server.
- `db_scanner_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the database scanner.
- `eval_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the evaluator.
- `db_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the database.
- `context_store_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the context store.
- `vector_store_impl`: Specifies the implementation class for the vector store.
- `db_name`: The name of the MongoDB database.
- `db_uri`: The URI for connecting to MongoDB.
- `openai_api_key`: The API key for OpenAI services.
- `encrypt_key`: The encryption key used for secure operations.
- `s3_aws_access_key_id`: The AWS access key ID for S3 services.
- `s3_aws_secret_access_key`: The AWS secret access key for S3 services.
- `only_store_csv_files_locally`: A flag indicating whether to store CSV files only locally.

#### Methods

- `require(key: str) -> Any`: Ensures that a configuration value is present and returns it.
- `__getitem__(key: str) -> Any`: Allows dictionary-like access to configuration attributes.

### `Component` Abstract Class

The `Component` class is an abstract base class that defines a common interface for all components in the system. It enforces method overrides using the `EnforceOverrides` mixin.

#### Attributes

- `_running`: A boolean indicating whether the component is currently running.

#### Methods

- `stop() -> None`: Stops the component and frees associated resources.
- `start() -> None`: Starts the component.

### `System` Class

The `System` class is a concrete implementation of `Component` and is responsible for managing instances of components within the system.

#### Attributes

- `settings`: An instance of the `Settings` class containing configuration settings.
- `_instances`: A dictionary mapping component types to their instances.

#### Methods

- `instance(type: Type[T]) -> T`: Returns an instance of the specified component type, starting it if the system is running.

### `get_class(fqn: str, type: Type[C]) -> Type[C]`

A function that imports a module given its fully qualified name (FQN) and returns the specified class.

### `get_fqn(cls: Type[object]) -> str`

A function that returns the fully qualified name of a given class.

## Usage

1. The `Settings` class is instantiated, typically at the start of the application, to load and access configuration settings from environment variables.
2. The `System` class is instantiated with an instance of `Settings`. It manages component instances and ensures that abstract components are instantiated with their concrete implementations as defined in the settings.
3. Components within the system can be started or stopped using their respective methods, and new component instances can be retrieved using the `System` instance's `instance` method.
4. The `get_class` and `get_fqn` functions are utility functions used internally by the `System` class to handle dynamic importing and instantiation of components based on their fully qualified names.

## Configuration

The module uses environment variables to configure the system. It expects the following environment variables to be set:

- `API_SERVER`
- `DB_SCANNER`
- `EVALUATOR`
- `DB`
- `CONTEXT_STORE`
- `VECTOR_STORE`
- `MONGODB_DB_NAME`
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ENCRYPT_KEY`
- `S3_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `S3_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `ONLY_STORE_CSV_FILES_LOCALLY`

If these variables are not set, default values are used where provided. The `Settings` class uses the `dotenv` library to load these variables from a `.env` file at runtime.

## Abstract Type Keys

The module defines a dictionary `_abstract_type_keys` that maps abstract component types to their corresponding environment variable keys. This mapping is used by the `System` class to resolve and instantiate concrete implementations of abstract components.
