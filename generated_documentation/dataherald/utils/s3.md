# S3 Class

## Overview

The `S3` class provides an interface for uploading and downloading files to and from Amazon S3 storage using the `boto3` library. It supports operations with optional encryption and decryption of credentials using the `FernetEncrypt` class from the `dataherald.utils.encrypt` module.

## Attributes

- `settings`: An instance of the `Settings` class from the `dataherald.config` module, which contains configuration settings for the project.

## Methods

### `__init__(self)`

The constructor initializes the `S3` class by setting the `settings` attribute to an instance of the `Settings` class.

### `upload(self, file_location, file_storage: FileStorage | None = None) -> str`

Uploads a file to an S3 bucket.

#### Parameters

- `file_location`: A string representing the local file path of the file to be uploaded.
- `file_storage`: An optional `FileStorage` object that contains S3 bucket details and encrypted AWS credentials. If not provided, the default settings from the `Settings` instance are used.

#### Returns

- A string representing the S3 URI of the uploaded file in the format `s3://bucket_name/file_name`.

#### Behavior

1. Extracts the file name from the `file_location` by splitting the string on `/` and taking the last element.
2. Sets the default bucket name to `"k2-core"`.
3. If a `FileStorage` object is provided, it initializes a `FernetEncrypt` instance to decrypt the AWS credentials stored in `FileStorage`. It then creates an S3 client with these decrypted credentials and the specified region.
4. If no `FileStorage` object is provided, it creates an S3 client using the AWS credentials from the `settings` attribute.
5. Calls the `upload_file` method of the S3 client to upload the file to the specified bucket using the base name of the file location.
6. Removes the local file after successful upload.
7. Constructs and returns the S3 URI of the uploaded file.

### `download(self, path: str, file_storage: FileStorage | None = None) -> str`

Downloads a file from an S3 bucket.

#### Parameters

- `path`: A string representing the S3 URI of the file to be downloaded.
- `file_storage`: An optional `FileStorage` object that contains S3 bucket details and encrypted AWS credentials. If not provided, the default settings from the `Settings` instance are used.

#### Returns

- A string representing the local file path of the downloaded file.

#### Behavior

1. Initializes a `FernetEncrypt` instance for potential decryption of file content.
2. Splits the `path` string on `/` to separate the bucket name and file key.
3. If a `FileStorage` object is provided, it decrypts the AWS credentials and creates an S3 client with these credentials and the specified region.
4. If no `FileStorage` object is provided, it creates an S3 client using the AWS credentials from the `settings` attribute.
5. Sets the local file location to a temporary directory with the name of the file to be downloaded.
6. Constructs the S3 file key from the remaining elements of the split `path`.
7. Calls the `download_file` method of the S3 client to download the file to the specified local file location.
8. Attempts to decrypt the file content using the `FernetEncrypt` instance. If decryption is successful, it writes the decrypted content back to the file. If decryption fails due to an `InvalidToken` or `UnicodeDecodeError`, it does nothing.
9. Returns the local file path of the downloaded file.

## Usage

The `S3` class is used in the project to handle file uploads and downloads to and from Amazon S3 storage. It abstracts the complexity of AWS credentials management and file encryption/decryption, providing a simple interface for file transfer operations.

## Dependencies

- `os`: Standard Python module for interacting with the operating system.
- `boto3`: Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, used for interacting with AWS services.
- `cryptography.fernet.InvalidToken`: Exception class for handling invalid encryption tokens.
- `dataherald.config.Settings`: Configuration settings class for the project.
- `dataherald.sql_database.models.types.FileStorage`: Data model class representing file storage details.
- `dataherald.utils.encrypt.FernetEncrypt`: Utility class for encrypting and decrypting data.
