# FernetEncrypt Class

## Overview

The `FernetEncrypt` class is a utility within the `dataherald` project that provides encryption and decryption functionality using the Fernet symmetric encryption method provided by the `cryptography` Python library. This class is designed to handle string data, ensuring that sensitive information can be securely stored and transmitted.

## Initialization

### `__init__(self)`

The constructor method initializes an instance of the `FernetEncrypt` class.

#### Attributes

- `self.fernet_key`: An instance of the `Fernet` class from the `cryptography.fernet` module, which is initialized with an encryption key obtained from the project's settings.

#### Process

1. An instance of the `Settings` class from `dataherald.config` is created.
2. The `Settings` instance is used to retrieve the encryption key by calling the `require` method with the argument `"encrypt_key"`.
3. The retrieved encryption key is used to create a `Fernet` object, which is assigned to `self.fernet_key`.

## Methods

### `encrypt(self, input: str) -> str`

The `encrypt` method takes a string as input and returns an encrypted version of that string.

#### Parameters

- `input`: A string to be encrypted.

#### Returns

- A string representing the encrypted input.

#### Process

1. If the input string is empty, the method immediately returns an empty string.
2. If the input string is not empty, it is encoded to bytes using the `encode` method with the default encoding (UTF-8).
3. The `self.fernet_key` object's `encrypt` method is called with the encoded byte string, which returns the encrypted data as a byte string.
4. The encrypted byte string is then decoded back into a UTF-8 encoded string and returned.

### `decrypt(self, input: str) -> str`

The `decrypt` method takes an encrypted string as input and returns the decrypted version of that string.

#### Parameters

- `input`: An encrypted string to be decrypted.

#### Returns

- A string representing the decrypted input.

#### Process

1. If the input string is empty, the method immediately returns an empty string.
2. If the input string is not empty, it is assumed to be a byte string encoded in UTF-8 representing the encrypted data.
3. The `self.fernet_key` object's `decrypt` method is called with the encrypted byte string, which returns the original unencrypted data as a byte string.
4. The decrypted byte string is then decoded back into a UTF-8 encoded string and returned.

## Usage

The `FernetEncrypt` class is used within the `dataherald` project to encrypt and decrypt strings that may contain sensitive information. It ensures that this information is stored and transmitted securely. The class is typically instantiated once and then used to encrypt or decrypt strings as needed throughout the project.

## Dependencies

- `cryptography.fernet.Fernet`: Used for encryption and decryption operations.
- `dataherald.config.Settings`: Used to retrieve the encryption key from the project's settings.

## Security Considerations

- The encryption key used by the `FernetEncrypt` class should be kept secret and stored securely.
- The Fernet encryption algorithm is symmetric, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. If the key is compromised, the security of the encrypted data is also compromised.
- It is important to ensure that the encryption key has sufficient entropy and is generated using a cryptographically secure method.
