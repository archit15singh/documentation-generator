# TestBase Module

## Overview

The `test_base.py` module is part of the `dataherald` project, specifically within the `tests/db_scanner/repository` directory. This module provides a base class for database repository tests, offering common setup and teardown procedures, as well as utility methods that can be used by test cases that inherit from it.

## Usage

The `TestBase` class is designed to be subclassed by other test modules that require a standardized testing environment for database interactions. It is not intended to be instantiated directly in test cases but serves as a foundation for other test classes.

## Class: TestBase

### Description

The `TestBase` class is an abstract base class that sets up a testing framework for database repository tests. It includes setup and teardown methods that handle the creation and cleanup of a temporary database environment, ensuring that each test runs in isolation.

### Methods

#### `setUpClass(cls)`

- **Description**: A class method that is called before any tests are run. It is responsible for setting up any class-level fixtures that are shared across all test cases. Typically, this might involve establishing a connection to a test database or creating shared resources.
- **Parameters**: `cls` - A reference to the class.
- **Returns**: None.

#### `tearDownClass(cls)`

- **Description**: A class method that is called after all tests in the class have been run. It is responsible for cleaning up any resources that were set up in the `setUpClass` method. This might involve closing database connections or deleting temporary data.
- **Parameters**: `cls` - A reference to the class.
- **Returns**: None.

#### `setUp(self)`

- **Description**: An instance method called before each test method is executed. It sets up the test environment for the specific test, such as initializing database transactions or resetting the state of the database to a known state.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Returns**: None.

#### `tearDown(self)`

- **Description**: An instance method called after each test method has been executed. It is responsible for cleaning up after the test, such as rolling back database transactions or removing test data.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Returns**: None.

### Attributes

The `TestBase` class may also define a set of attributes that are used to configure the test environment. These could include:

- `db_connection_string`: A string that specifies the connection details for the test database.
- `test_data`: A collection of data that is used to populate the database for testing purposes.

## Test Cases

Test cases that inherit from `TestBase` should implement their own test methods. These methods will typically follow this structure:

1. Call the `setUp` method to prepare the test environment.
2. Execute the code that is being tested, such as database queries or repository methods.
3. Assert the expected outcomes of the code execution.
4. Call the `tearDown` method to clean up the test environment.

## Example

Below is an example of how a test case might inherit from `TestBase`:

```python
from dataherald.tests.db_scanner.repository.test_base import TestBase

class TestExampleRepository(TestBase):

    def test_some_database_functionality(self):
        # Arrange
        self.setUp()
        # Act
        result = self.some_repository_method()
        # Assert
        self.assertEqual(expected_result, result)
        # Cleanup
        self.tearDown()
```

In this example, `TestExampleRepository` inherits from `TestBase`, and the test method `test_some_database_functionality` uses the setup and teardown methods to ensure a consistent test environment.
