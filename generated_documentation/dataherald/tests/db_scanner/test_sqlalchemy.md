# `test_sqlalchemy.py` Module

## Overview

The `test_sqlalchemy.py` module is part of the test suite for the `dataherald` project, specifically focusing on testing the functionality related to SQLAlchemy database interactions. This module contains a collection of test cases that verify the correct behavior of the database scanning features provided by the `dataherald` application.

## Dependencies

- `pytest`: A framework used for writing and running tests.
- `sqlalchemy`: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- `dataherald`: The main project package that this test module is designed to test.

## Test Cases

### `test_connect_database()`

#### Description

This test case verifies that the application can successfully connect to a database using SQLAlchemy. It checks if the connection object is valid and if the connection can be established without any exceptions.

#### Steps

1. Set up a test database URI.
2. Attempt to connect to the database using the `dataherald` connection method.
3. Assert that the connection is successful and the connection object is not `None`.

### `test_scan_tables()`

#### Description

This test case ensures that the application can correctly scan and retrieve a list of tables from the connected database. It checks if all expected tables are present and if their names match the expected values.

#### Steps

1. Connect to the test database.
2. Invoke the table scanning method from the `dataherald` application.
3. Assert that the returned list of tables matches the expected list of table names.

### `test_scan_columns()`

#### Description

This test case checks whether the application can accurately scan and list the columns of a specific table in the database. It verifies the column names, types, and other properties.

#### Steps

1. Connect to the test database and select a target table.
2. Invoke the column scanning method for the target table.
3. Assert that the returned list of columns contains the correct column names and types as expected.

### `test_scan_primary_keys()`

#### Description

This test case is designed to verify that the application can identify and list the primary keys of a given table. It ensures that primary key constraints are correctly recognized.

#### Steps

1. Connect to the test database and select a target table with known primary keys.
2. Invoke the primary key scanning method for the target table.
3. Assert that the returned list of primary keys matches the expected primary key columns.

### `test_scan_foreign_keys()`

#### Description

This test case tests the application's ability to detect and list foreign key relationships between tables in the database. It checks for the correct identification of foreign key columns and their referenced tables and columns.

#### Steps

1. Connect to the test database and select a target table with known foreign key relationships.
2. Invoke the foreign key scanning method for the target table.
3. Assert that the returned foreign key mappings are correct, including the local and referenced column names.

### `test_scan_indexes()`

#### Description

This test case ensures that the application can correctly identify and list the indexes on a table, including unique and composite indexes.

#### Steps

1. Connect to the test database and select a target table with known indexes.
2. Invoke the index scanning method for the target table.
3. Assert that the returned list of indexes matches the expected index definitions, including the index names and associated columns.

## Usage

The `test_sqlalchemy.py` module is executed as part of the automated test suite for the `dataherald` project. It is typically run using a test runner such as `pytest` that collects and runs all the test cases defined within the module. The tests can be executed in isolation or as part of a larger test suite to ensure the stability and correctness of the database scanning functionality within the `dataherald` application.

To run the tests in this module, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
pytest /workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/tests/db_scanner/test_sqlalchemy.py
```

This will trigger the test runner to execute each test case in `test_sqlalchemy.py`, reporting success or failure for each one and providing a summary of the test results upon completion.
```
