# TestGenerator Class

## Overview

The `TestGenerator` class is a subclass of `SQLGenerator` and is designed for testing purposes within the `dataherald` project. It provides a mock implementation of the `generate_response` method, which is used to simulate the generation of SQL queries based on user prompts and database connections.

## Attributes

The `TestGenerator` class does not define any additional attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class, `SQLGenerator`.

## Constructor

### `__init__(self, system: System)`

The constructor takes a single argument:

- `system`: An instance of the `System` class from the `dataherald.config` module. This argument is not used in the current implementation of the `TestGenerator` class.

The constructor does not perform any actions and is effectively a placeholder.

## Methods

### `generate_response(self, user_prompt: Prompt, database_connection: DatabaseConnection, context: List[dict] = None) -> SQLGeneration`

This method overrides the `generate_response` method from the `SQLGenerator` class and is responsible for generating a mock SQL response.

#### Parameters

- `user_prompt`: An instance of the `Prompt` class, representing the user's input or query for which SQL code needs to be generated.
- `database_connection`: An instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class, representing the connection details to the database against which the SQL query will be executed.
- `context` (optional): A list of dictionaries that provide additional context for generating the SQL response. This parameter is not used in the current implementation and is marked with `# noqa: ARG002` to ignore a specific linting rule.

#### Returns

- `SQLGeneration`: An instance of the `SQLGeneration` class, which contains the following mock data:
  - `question_id`: A hardcoded string `"651f2d76275132d5b65175eb"`, representing a mock identifier for the user's prompt.
  - `sql`: A hardcoded string `"Foo response"`, representing a mock SQL query.
  - `status`: A hardcoded string `"bar"`, representing a mock status of the SQL generation process.

## Usage

The `TestGenerator` class is used in test cases within the `dataherald` project to verify the behavior of components that interact with instances of `SQLGenerator`. Since it provides a predictable and controlled output, it is useful for testing without the need for an actual database connection or complex SQL generation logic.

## Example

To use the `TestGenerator` class in a test case, one would instantiate it and call the `generate_response` method with mock `Prompt` and `DatabaseConnection` objects. The returned `SQLGeneration` object would then be used to assert that the correct behavior occurs in the component under test.

```python
# Example usage in a test case
test_system = System()
test_generator = TestGenerator(system=test_system)
mock_prompt = Prompt(...)
mock_database_connection = DatabaseConnection(...)

# Generate the mock SQL response
sql_generation = test_generator.generate_response(
    user_prompt=mock_prompt,
    database_connection=mock_database_connection
)

# Assertions can be made here to verify the expected behavior
assert sql_generation.question_id == "651f2d76275132d5b65175eb"
assert sql_generation.sql == "Foo response"
assert sql_generation.status == "bar"
```

The `TestGenerator` class simplifies the testing process by providing a consistent and simple output that can be easily checked against expected values.
