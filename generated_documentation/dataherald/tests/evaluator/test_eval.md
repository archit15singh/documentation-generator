# TestEvaluator Class

## Overview

The `TestEvaluator` class is a subclass of the `Evaluator` class, designed for testing purposes within the `dataherald` project. It provides a mock implementation of the methods required by the `Evaluator` interface, specifically tailored for use in test scenarios where interactions with real evaluation logic are not necessary or desired.

## Usage

The `TestEvaluator` class is used in the context of unit tests for the `dataherald` project. It allows developers to test the functionality of components that depend on an `Evaluator` without requiring a fully implemented evaluation system.

## Initialization

### `__init__(self, system: System)`

The constructor of the `TestEvaluator` class takes a single argument:

- `system`: An instance of the `System` class from the `dataherald.config` module. In this mock implementation, the `system` parameter is not used, and the constructor body is empty.

## Methods

### `get_confidence_score(self, user_prompt: Prompt, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> confloat`

This method is an override of the `get_confidence_score` method from the `Evaluator` base class. It calculates a confidence score indicating the likelihood that the generated SQL query (`sql_generation`) correctly represents the user's intent as expressed in the `user_prompt`.

#### Parameters

- `user_prompt`: An instance of the `Prompt` class, representing the user's input.
- `sql_generation`: An instance of the `SQLGeneration` class, representing the generated SQL query.
- `database_connection`: An instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class, representing the database connection details.

#### Returns

- A `confloat` type representing the confidence score, which is a float constrained between 0 and 1 (inclusive). In this mock implementation, the method always returns a fixed score of `1.0`, indicating full confidence.

### `evaluate(self, user_prompt: Prompt, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> Evaluation`

This method is an override of the `evaluate` method from the `Evaluator` base class. It evaluates the generated SQL query (`sql_generation`) against the user's prompt (`user_prompt`) and returns an `Evaluation` object.

#### Parameters

- `user_prompt`: An instance of the `Prompt` class, representing the user's input.
- `sql_generation`: An instance of the `SQLGeneration` class, representing the generated SQL query.
- `database_connection`: An instance of the `DatabaseConnection` class, representing the database connection details.

#### Returns

- An `Evaluation` object with the following attributes:
  - `question_id`: A string representing the identifier of the user's prompt. In this mock implementation, it is set to `"0"`.
  - `answer_id`: A string representing the identifier of the generated SQL query. In this mock implementation, it is set to `"0"`.
  - `score`: A `confloat` representing the evaluation score. In this mock implementation, it is set to `0.8`.

## Dependencies

- `overrides`: A Python package used to indicate that a method overrides a method from the superclass.
- `pydantic`: A data validation and settings management library used for defining the `confloat` type.
- `dataherald.config`: A module containing the `System` class, which holds configuration details for the `dataherald` project.
- `dataherald.eval`: A module containing the `Evaluation` and `Evaluator` classes, which define the evaluation interface and data structures.
- `dataherald.sql_database.models.types`: A module containing the `DatabaseConnection` class, which defines the structure for database connection details.
- `dataherald.types`: A module containing the `Prompt` and `SQLGeneration` classes, which define the structure for user prompts and SQL query generations.

## File Location

The `TestEvaluator` class is defined in the file located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/tests/evaluator/test_eval.py` within the `dataherald` project. This file is part of the test suite for the evaluation component of the project.
