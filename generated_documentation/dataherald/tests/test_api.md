# Test API Module

## Overview

The `test_api.py` module is part of the test suite for the `dataherald` project. It is designed to test the API endpoints provided by the FastAPI application defined in `dataherald.app`. The tests are executed using the `TestClient` from FastAPI's `testclient` module, which allows for the simulation of sending HTTP requests to the API without running a server.

## Dependencies

- `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`: A class that allows for testing FastAPI applications with a mock client that can simulate HTTP requests.
- `dataherald.app.app`: The FastAPI application instance that defines the API endpoints to be tested.

## Constants

- `HTTP_200_CODE`: The HTTP status code for a successful request.
- `HTTP_201_CODE`: The HTTP status code for a request that resulted in the creation of a new resource.
- `HTTP_404_CODE`: The HTTP status code for a request to a resource that does not exist.

## TestClient Setup

A `TestClient` instance is created by passing the FastAPI application (`app`) to it. This client is used to make requests to the API endpoints and assert the responses in the test functions.

```python
client = TestClient(app)
```

## Test Functions

### `test_heartbeat()`

This test function verifies that the `/api/v1/heartbeat` endpoint is functioning correctly. It sends a `GET` request to the endpoint and asserts that the response status code is `200`, indicating success.

```python
def test_heartbeat():
    response = client.get("/api/v1/heartbeat")
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_200_CODE
```

### `test_scan_all_tables()`

This test function checks the functionality of the `/api/v1/table-descriptions/sync-schemas` endpoint for synchronizing all table schemas. It sends a `POST` request with a JSON payload containing a `db_connection_id`. The test asserts that the response status code is `201`, indicating that the resource was created successfully.

```python
def test_scan_all_tables():
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/table-descriptions/sync-schemas",
        json={"db_connection_id": "64dfa0e103f5134086f7090c"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_201_CODE
```

### `test_scan_one_table()`

This test function is designed to test the synchronization of a single table schema. It attempts to send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/table-descriptions/sync-schemas` endpoint with a JSON payload that includes a `db_connection_id` and a list of `table_names`. The test is wrapped in a `try` block to catch a `ValueError` exception, which is expected to be raised if no table is found. The test asserts that the exception message matches "No table found".

```python
def test_scan_one_table():
    try:
        client.post(
            "/api/v1/table-descriptions/sync-schemas",
            json={
                "db_connection_id": "64dfa0e103f5134086f7090c",
                "table_names": ["foo"],
            },
        )
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "No table found"
```

## Usage

The test functions in this module are typically executed as part of an automated test suite. They can be run using a test runner that is compatible with the testing framework used in the `dataherald` project (e.g., `pytest`). The tests validate that the API endpoints behave as expected when accessed through the `TestClient`.
