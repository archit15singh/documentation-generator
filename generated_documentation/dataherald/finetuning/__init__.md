# FinetuningModel Class

## Overview

The `FinetuningModel` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the interface for fine-tuning models within the `dataherald` project. It inherits from the `Component` class defined in the `dataherald.config` module and the `ABC` class from the `abc` module. The class outlines the structure and required methods that any fine-tuning model component must implement to be compatible with the `dataherald` system.

## Attributes

- `storage`: This attribute holds a reference to a storage component that the fine-tuning model will use to access and store data.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, storage)`

The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `FinetuningModel` class.

#### Parameters

- `storage`: A storage component that the fine-tuning model will use for data operations.

### `count_tokens(self, messages: dict) -> int`

An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It should count the number of tokens in the provided messages.

#### Parameters

- `messages`: A dictionary containing the messages to be tokenized and counted.

#### Returns

- An integer representing the total number of tokens in the messages.

### `create_fintuning_dataset(self)`

An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It should handle the creation of a dataset suitable for fine-tuning the model.

### `create_fine_tuning_job(self)`

An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It should initiate a fine-tuning job for the model.

### `retrieve_finetuning_job(self) -> Finetuning`

An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It should retrieve the status or result of a fine-tuning job.

#### Returns

- A `Finetuning` object representing the state or outcome of the fine-tuning job.

### `cancel_finetuning_job(self) -> Finetuning`

An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It should cancel an ongoing fine-tuning job.

#### Returns

- A `Finetuning` object representing the state of the fine-tuning job after the cancellation attempt.

## Usage

The `FinetuningModel` class is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for creating concrete classes that implement the fine-tuning logic specific to different types of models. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods defined in this class.

When a subclass is created, it must override the abstract methods with actual working code that performs the necessary tasks for fine-tuning a model, such as counting tokens, creating datasets, managing fine-tuning jobs, and handling job cancellations.

The `FinetuningModel` class ensures that all fine-tuning components within the `dataherald` project adhere to a consistent interface, making it easier to manage and interchange different fine-tuning strategies within the system.
