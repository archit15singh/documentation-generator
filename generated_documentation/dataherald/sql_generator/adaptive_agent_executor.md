# AdaptiveAgentExecutor Class

## Overview

`AdaptiveAgentExecutor` is a subclass of `AgentExecutor` that is designed to execute a sequence of actions determined by an agent. It is capable of handling single and multi-action agents, managing tools, and adapting the execution based on the context size and token count.

## Attributes

- `agent`: An instance of either `BaseSingleActionAgent` or `BaseMultiActionAgent` that defines the agent to be executed.
- `tools`: A sequence of `BaseTool` instances that the agent can use to perform actions.
- `return_intermediate_steps`: A boolean indicating whether to return intermediate steps of execution.
- `max_iterations`: An optional integer specifying the maximum number of iterations to execute.
- `max_execution_time`: An optional float specifying the maximum execution time in seconds.
- `early_stopping_method`: A string indicating the method for early stopping, defaulting to "force".
- `handle_parsing_errors`: A union type that can be a boolean, a string, or a callable function to handle parsing errors.
- `trim_intermediate_steps`: A union type that can be an integer or a callable function to trim intermediate steps.
- `llm_list`: A dictionary containing different language model instances.
- `switch_to_larger_model_threshold`: An integer specifying the token count threshold to switch to a larger language model.
- `enc`: An instance of `Encoding` used for token counting.
- `tokens`: An integer representing the initial token count based on the agent's prompt template.

## Methods

### from_agent_and_tools

A class method that creates an instance of `AdaptiveAgentExecutor` from the given agent, tools, and additional parameters.

#### Parameters

- `agent`: The agent to be executed.
- `tools`: The tools available for the agent to use.
- `llm_list`: A dictionary of language model instances.
- `switch_to_larger_model_threshold`: The token count threshold for switching language models.
- `encoding`: The encoding instance for token counting.
- `callbacks`: Optional `Callbacks` instance for managing callbacks during execution.
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments.

#### Returns

- An instance of `AgentExecutor`.

### token_counter

Calculates the total token count including the tokens from intermediate steps.

#### Parameters

- `intermediate_steps`: A list of tuples containing `AgentAction` and the corresponding output string.

#### Returns

- An integer representing the updated token count.

### _take_next_step

An overridden method that executes the next step in the agent's plan.

#### Parameters

- `name_to_tool_map`: A dictionary mapping tool names to `BaseTool` instances.
- `color_mapping`: A dictionary mapping tool names to their corresponding color for output.
- `inputs`: A dictionary of input values for the agent.
- `intermediate_steps`: A list of tuples containing `AgentAction` and the corresponding output string.
- `run_manager`: An optional `CallbackManagerForChainRun` instance for managing callbacks.

#### Returns

- Either an `AgentFinish` instance if the execution is complete or a list of tuples containing `AgentAction` and the corresponding output string.

#### Behavior

1. Prepares intermediate steps.
2. Checks if the token count exceeds the threshold and switches to a larger language model if necessary.
3. Calls the agent's `plan` method to determine the next action(s).
4. Handles `OutputParserException` errors based on the `handle_parsing_errors` attribute.
5. Executes the chosen tool's `run` method with the tool input to obtain an observation.
6. Appends the `AgentAction` and observation to the result list.
7. Returns the result list or an `AgentFinish` instance.

## Usage

`AdaptiveAgentExecutor` is used within a project to execute an agent that can perform a sequence of actions using various tools. It adapts to the context size by switching between language models and manages token counts to ensure efficient execution. It is typically instantiated with the `from_agent_and_tools` class method and then used to execute the agent's plan step by step with the `_take_next_step` method.
