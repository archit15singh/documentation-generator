# Dataherald SQL Agent (`dataherald_sqlagent.py`)

## Overview

The `dataherald_sqlagent.py` module is part of the Dataherald project and is responsible for generating SQL queries based on user prompts. It leverages a combination of machine learning models, specifically language models from OpenAI, and a set of custom tools to interpret user questions and generate corresponding SQL queries that can be executed against a database.

## Dependencies

- `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
- `difflib`: For finding differences between sequences.
- `logging`: For logging messages.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `queue`: For queue data structure to handle streaming data.
- `threading`: For running operations in separate threads.
- `typing`: For type annotations.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations, especially for calculating cosine similarity.
- `openai`: For interacting with OpenAI's language models.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `sqlalchemy`: For SQL database interaction.
- `google.api_core.exceptions`: For handling Google API errors.
- `langchain`: For chaining language models and tools.
- `overrides`: For method overriding.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and settings management through Python data classes.
- `dataherald`: For accessing the project's internal modules and utilities.

## Main Components

### Decorators

- `catch_exceptions`: A decorator to catch and handle exceptions from various sources, including OpenAI API errors, Google API errors, and SQLAlchemy errors.

### Helper Functions

- `replace_unprocessable_characters`: Replaces unprocessable characters in a string with a space.

### Classes

#### BaseSQLDatabaseTool

- Base class for tools interacting with the SQL database and context information.

#### SystemTime

- Tool for retrieving the current date and time.

#### QuerySQLDataBaseTool

- Tool for executing SQL queries against a database.

#### GetUserInstructions

- Tool for retrieving database admin instructions.

#### TablesSQLDatabaseTool

- Tool for identifying relevant tables based on a user question.

#### ColumnEntityChecker

- Tool for checking the existence of an entity within a column.

#### SchemaSQLDatabaseTool

- Tool for retrieving the schema of specified tables.

#### InfoRelevantColumns

- Tool for gathering details about potentially relevant columns.

#### GetFewShotExamples

- Tool for fetching few-shot examples to aid in SQL query generation.

#### SQLDatabaseToolkit

- Toolkit that aggregates various tools for SQL database interaction.

### DataheraldSQLAgent

- The main agent responsible for generating SQL queries based on user prompts. It orchestrates the interaction between the language model, the toolkit, and the database.

## Methods

### DataheraldSQLAgent Methods

#### `remove_duplicate_examples`

- Removes duplicate examples from a list of few-shot examples.

#### `create_sql_agent`

- Constructs an SQL agent from a language model and a set of tools.

#### `generate_response`

- Generates an SQL query in response to a user prompt.

#### `stream_response`

- Streams the response of the SQL query generation process.

## Usage

The `DataheraldSQLAgent` class is instantiated and used to generate SQL queries. It requires a user prompt and a database connection to function. The agent uses a combination of few-shot examples, admin instructions, and a set of custom tools to generate a query that matches the user's intent. The process can be streamed, allowing for real-time updates and interaction.

## Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling to manage various exceptions that may occur during the query generation process, such as authentication errors, rate limit errors, and SQL execution errors.

## Logging

The module uses the `logging` library to log information, warnings, and errors throughout the execution of the agent.

## Environment Variables

The module relies on environment variables for configuration, such as `SQL_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT`, `AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS`, and `DH_ENGINE_TIMEOUT`, which control various timeouts and limits within the agent's execution.

## Threading

The `stream_response` method uses the `threading` module to run the streaming process in a separate thread, allowing the main program to continue execution without blocking.

## Streaming

The agent supports streaming the SQL generation process, which involves sending intermediate steps and results to a queue that can be consumed by other parts of the application or by the end-user.

## Database Interaction

The module interacts with SQL databases using SQLAlchemy for executing queries and retrieving schema information. It also uses custom database models and repositories from the `dataherald` package for managing database-related operations.

## Machine Learning Models

The agent leverages OpenAI's language models to interpret user prompts and generate SQL queries. It uses embeddings to calculate relevance scores for tables and employs few-shot learning techniques to improve the quality of the generated queries.
