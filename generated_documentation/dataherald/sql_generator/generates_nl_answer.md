# GeneratesNlAnswer Class

## Overview

The `GeneratesNlAnswer` class is responsible for generating a natural language (NL) answer based on a given SQL query and its result. It utilizes a language model chain to process the input and produce a human-like response.

## Attributes

- `system`: An instance or identifier of the system that is used to interact with the language model.
- `storage`: A storage system where the prompts and database connection information are stored.
- `llm_config`: An instance of `LLMConfig` containing configuration details for the language model, such as the model name and API base URL.
- `model`: An instance of `ChatModel` initialized with the `system` attribute.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, system, storage, llm_config: LLMConfig)`

The constructor initializes the `GeneratesNlAnswer` class with the provided system, storage, and language model configuration.

### `execute(self, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, top_k: int = 100) -> NLGeneration`

The `execute` method is the core function of the class. It takes an `SQLGeneration` object, which contains the SQL query and associated metadata, and an optional `top_k` parameter that limits the number of SQL query results processed.

#### Steps:

1. Retrieve the prompt associated with the SQL query using `PromptRepository` and the `storage` attribute.
2. Fetch the database connection details using `DatabaseConnectionRepository` and the `storage` attribute.
3. Initialize the language model (`self.llm`) with the database connection details and the `llm_config`.
4. Create a SQL engine instance using `SQLDatabase.get_sql_engine` with the database connection details.
5. If the `sql_generation` status is "INVALID", return an `NLGeneration` object with a message indicating the SQL query is invalid.
6. Execute the SQL query using the SQL engine:
   - Parse the SQL query to filter out commands that could lead to SQL injection.
   - Connect to the database and execute the query, fetching up to `top_k` results.
   - Process each row of the result to convert `date`, `datetime`, and `Decimal` types to string or float, respectively.
7. If a `SQLInjectionError` is raised during query execution, propagate the error with an additional message.
8. Prepare the language model prompt using `HumanMessagePromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` with the human-readable template defined in `HUMAN_TEMPLATE`.
9. Invoke the language model chain (`LLMChain`) with the prompt and the processed SQL query and results.
10. Return an `NLGeneration` object containing the generated natural language response and metadata such as the `sql_generation` ID and the current timestamp.

## Usage

The `GeneratesNlAnswer` class is used within a project to convert SQL query results into a natural language format that is easily understandable by humans. It is particularly useful in applications that require interaction with users in natural language, such as chatbots or virtual assistants that provide data insights based on SQL queries.

## Error Handling

The class includes error handling for SQL injection attempts by raising a `SQLInjectionError` if sensitive SQL keywords are detected in the query.

## Dependencies

- `datetime`: For handling date and time objects.
- `decimal`: For handling decimal numbers.
- `langchain.chains`: For the language model chain.
- `langchain.prompts.chat`: For creating chat prompts.
- `sqlalchemy`: For executing SQL queries.
- `dataherald.model.chat_model`: For the chat model.
- `dataherald.repositories.database_connections`: For fetching database connection details.
- `dataherald.repositories.prompts`: For fetching prompts.
- `dataherald.sql_database.base`: For SQL database operations.
- `dataherald.types`: For type definitions used in the class.

## Constants

- `HUMAN_TEMPLATE`: A template string used to format the prompt for the language model, which includes placeholders for the question, SQL query, and SQL query result.
