# ContextStore Module

## Overview

The `ContextStore` module, located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/context_store/__init__.py`, is an abstract base class that defines the interface for context storage in the DataHerald project. It is designed to interact with a database and a vector store to manage and retrieve context-related data for given prompts. The module is part of the `dataherald` package and is intended to be subclassed by concrete implementations that provide the actual storage and retrieval logic.

## Dependencies

- `os`: Standard Python module to interact with the operating system.
- `abc.ABC, abc.abstractmethod`: Abstract Base Classes (ABC) module to define abstract base classes and abstract methods.
- `typing.List, typing.Tuple`: Typing module to specify type hints for lists and tuples.
- `dataherald.config.Component, dataherald.config.System`: Configuration classes from the `dataherald.config` module.
- `dataherald.db.DB`: Database class from the `dataherald.db` module.
- `dataherald.types.GoldenSQL, dataherald.types.GoldenSQLRequest, dataherald.types.Prompt`: Custom types from the `dataherald.types` module.
- `dataherald.vector_store.VectorStore`: VectorStore class from the `dataherald.vector_store` module.

## Class Definition

### ContextStore

`ContextStore` is an abstract base class that inherits from `Component` and `ABC`. It defines the structure and required methods for context storage components within the DataHerald project.

#### Attributes

- `DocStore: DB`: A class attribute that specifies the type of document store to be used, which is a database (`DB`).
- `VectorStore: VectorStore`: A class attribute that specifies the type of vector store to be used.
- `doc_store_collection: str`: A class attribute that holds the name of the collection within the document store where table metadata is stored.

#### Abstract Methods

1. `__init__(self, system: System)`: An abstract method that initializes the `ContextStore` with a reference to the `System` instance. It also initializes the database connection and the vector store, and sets the `golden_sql_collection` attribute based on an environment variable or a default value.

2. `retrieve_context_for_question(self, prompt: Prompt, number_of_samples: int = 3) -> Tuple[List[dict] | None, List[dict] | None]`: An abstract method that, when implemented, should retrieve context information for a given prompt. The method takes a `Prompt` object and an optional `number_of_samples` parameter, returning a tuple containing two lists of dictionaries or `None`.

3. `add_golden_sqls(self, golden_sqls: List[GoldenSQLRequest]) -> List[GoldenSQL]`: An abstract method that, when implemented, should add a list of `GoldenSQLRequest` objects to the context store and return a list of `GoldenSQL` objects representing the added SQLs.

4. `remove_golden_sqls(self, ids: List) -> bool`: An abstract method that, when implemented, should remove golden SQL entries based on a list of identifiers. It should return a boolean indicating the success of the operation.

## Usage

The `ContextStore` class is not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for concrete subclasses that implement the abstract methods. These subclasses will provide the functionality to store and retrieve context data, manage golden SQL queries, and interact with the document and vector stores as required by the DataHerald project.

Concrete implementations of `ContextStore` must provide the logic for connecting to the appropriate data stores, handling data queries, and managing the lifecycle of context-related data within the system.

## Environment Variables

- `GOLDEN_SQL_COLLECTION`: An environment variable that can be set to specify the name of the collection within the database where golden SQL queries are stored. If not set, the default value is `"dataherald-staging"`.

## Notes

- The `ContextStore` class is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for different storage backends and retrieval strategies to be implemented as needed.
- The use of abstract methods enforces a consistent interface for all context store implementations, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably within the DataHerald project.
- The `number_of_samples` parameter in the `retrieve_context_for_question` method allows for control over the amount of context data retrieved, which can be useful for performance tuning or limiting the scope of the context.
