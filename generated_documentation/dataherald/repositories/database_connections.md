# DatabaseConnectionRepository Class

## Overview

The `DatabaseConnectionRepository` class is responsible for managing the persistence of `DatabaseConnection` objects within a MongoDB collection. It provides an abstraction layer over the direct database access, offering methods to insert, find, update, and list `DatabaseConnection` instances. The class ensures that the `DatabaseConnection` objects are properly serialized and deserialized when stored and retrieved from the database.

## Attributes

- `storage`: An instance of a storage class that provides methods for interacting with the MongoDB database.

## Constants

- `DB_COLLECTION`: A string constant representing the name of the MongoDB collection where `DatabaseConnection` objects are stored.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, storage)`

The constructor initializes a new instance of the `DatabaseConnectionRepository` class.

#### Parameters

- `storage`: An instance of a storage class that provides methods for interacting with the MongoDB database.

### `insert(self, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> DatabaseConnection`

Inserts a new `DatabaseConnection` object into the MongoDB collection.

#### Parameters

- `database_connection`: An instance of `DatabaseConnection` to be inserted into the database.

#### Returns

- The `DatabaseConnection` object with its `id` attribute set to the MongoDB-generated `_id`.

### `find_one(self, query: dict) -> DatabaseConnection | None`

Finds a single `DatabaseConnection` object in the MongoDB collection that matches the given query.

#### Parameters

- `query`: A dictionary representing the MongoDB query used to find the object.

#### Returns

- A `DatabaseConnection` object if found, otherwise `None`.

### `update(self, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> DatabaseConnection`

Updates an existing `DatabaseConnection` object in the MongoDB collection or creates it if it does not exist.

#### Parameters

- `database_connection`: An instance of `DatabaseConnection` to be updated or created in the database.

#### Returns

- The `DatabaseConnection` object after the update.

### `find_by_id(self, id: str) -> DatabaseConnection | None`

Finds a `DatabaseConnection` object in the MongoDB collection by its `_id`.

#### Parameters

- `id`: A string representing the MongoDB `_id` of the `DatabaseConnection` object.

#### Returns

- A `DatabaseConnection` object if found, otherwise `None`.

### `find_all(self) -> list[DatabaseConnection]`

Retrieves all `DatabaseConnection` objects from the MongoDB collection.

#### Returns

- A list of `DatabaseConnection` objects.

## Exceptions

### `DatabaseConnectionNotFoundError`

A custom exception class that is raised when a `DatabaseConnection` object is not found in the database.

## Usage

The `DatabaseConnectionRepository` class is typically used by other components of the project that require access to `DatabaseConnection` objects stored in the database. It is instantiated with a storage object that knows how to interact with MongoDB. The repository methods are then used to perform CRUD operations on `DatabaseConnection` objects within the MongoDB collection named `database_connections`.

## Integration with MongoDB

The `DatabaseConnectionRepository` class interacts with MongoDB using the `storage` object's methods such as `insert_one`, `find_one`, `update_or_create`, and `find_all`. These methods abstract the actual MongoDB operations, allowing the repository to focus on the business logic related to `DatabaseConnection` objects.

## Serialization and Deserialization

When storing `DatabaseConnection` objects, the `dict` method is used to convert the object into a dictionary, excluding the `id` field, which is managed by MongoDB. When retrieving objects from the database, the class reconstructs `DatabaseConnection` instances from the dictionaries returned by the `storage` object, ensuring the `_id` field is converted to a string and assigned to the `id` attribute of the `DatabaseConnection` instance.
