# InstructionRepository Class

## Overview
The `InstructionRepository` class provides an abstraction layer for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection named `instructions` within a database. It is designed to work with `Instruction` objects, which are presumably a custom data type defined in the `dataherald.types` module.

## Attributes
- `storage`: An instance of a storage class that provides methods for interacting with the database.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, storage)`
Constructor for the `InstructionRepository` class.
- **Parameters**:
  - `storage`: An instance of a storage class.

### `insert(self, instruction: Instruction) -> Instruction`
Inserts a new `Instruction` object into the database.
- **Parameters**:
  - `instruction`: An `Instruction` object to be inserted into the database.
- **Returns**: The `Instruction` object with its `id` attribute set to the newly created database entry's ID.
- **Process**:
  1. Converts the `Instruction` object to a dictionary, excluding the `id` field.
  2. Converts the `db_connection_id` to a string and adds it to the dictionary.
  3. Inserts the dictionary into the database using the `storage` instance's `insert_one` method.
  4. Sets the `id` attribute of the `Instruction` object to the string representation of the newly inserted document's ID.
  5. Returns the updated `Instruction` object.

### `find_one(self, query: dict) -> Instruction | None`
Finds a single `Instruction` object in the database that matches the given query.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: A dictionary representing the query to find the document.
- **Returns**: An `Instruction` object if found, otherwise `None`.
- **Process**:
  1. Uses the `storage` instance's `find_one` method to search for a document in the database.
  2. If a document is found, converts the `_id` and `db_connection_id` fields to strings.
  3. Returns an `Instruction` object initialized with the document's data.

### `update(self, instruction: Instruction) -> Instruction`
Updates an existing `Instruction` object in the database.
- **Parameters**:
  - `instruction`: An `Instruction` object with updated fields.
- **Returns**: The `Instruction` object.
- **Process**:
  1. Converts the `Instruction` object to a dictionary, excluding the `id` field.
  2. Converts the `db_connection_id` to a string and adds it to the dictionary.
  3. Updates the corresponding document in the database using the `storage` instance's `update_or_create` method, matching by the `Instruction` object's `id`.
  4. Returns the `Instruction` object.

### `find_by_id(self, id: str) -> Instruction | None`
Finds an `Instruction` object by its ID.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id`: A string representing the `Instruction` object's ID.
- **Returns**: An `Instruction` object if found, otherwise `None`.
- **Process**:
  1. Uses the `storage` instance's `find_one` method to search for a document by its `_id`.
  2. If a document is found, converts the `_id` and `db_connection_id` fields to strings.
  3. Returns an `Instruction` object initialized with the document's data.

### `find_by(self, query: dict, page: int = 1, limit: int = 10) -> list[Instruction]`
Finds `Instruction` objects that match a given query, with pagination.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query`: A dictionary representing the query to find documents.
  - `page`: An integer representing the page number for pagination (default is 1).
  - `limit`: An integer representing the number of documents per page (default is 10).
- **Returns**: A list of `Instruction` objects.
- **Process**:
  1. Uses the `storage` instance's `find` method to search for documents with pagination.
  2. Converts the `_id` and `db_connection_id` fields of each document to strings.
  3. Initializes `Instruction` objects with the documents' data and appends them to a list.
  4. Returns the list of `Instruction` objects.

### `find_all(self, page: int = 0, limit: int = 0) -> list[Instruction]`
Finds all `Instruction` objects in the database, with optional pagination.
- **Parameters**:
  - `page`: An integer representing the page number for pagination (default is 0, which means no pagination).
  - `limit`: An integer representing the number of documents per page (default is 0, which means no limit).
- **Returns**: A list of `Instruction` objects.
- **Process**:
  1. Uses the `storage` instance's `find_all` method to retrieve all documents with optional pagination.
  2. Converts the `_id` and `db_connection_id` fields of each document to strings.
  3. Initializes `Instruction` objects with the documents' data and appends them to a list.
  4. Returns the list of `Instruction` objects.

### `delete_by_id(self, id: str) -> int`
Deletes an `Instruction` object by its ID.
- **Parameters**:
  - `id`: A string representing the `Instruction` object's ID.
- **Returns**: An integer indicating the number of documents deleted (should be 1 or 0).
- **Process**:
  1. Uses the `storage` instance's `delete_by_id` method to delete a document by its ID.
  2. Returns the result of the deletion operation.

## Usage
The `InstructionRepository` class is used to interact with the `instructions` collection in the database. It provides a high-level API for managing `Instruction` objects, abstracting away the details of the database operations. This class is typically used by other parts of the project that require data persistence for `Instruction` entities.
