# FinetuningsRepository Class

## Overview

The `FinetuningsRepository` class provides an abstraction layer for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database collection named `finetunings`. It uses a storage object passed to it during initialization to interact with the database. The class is designed to work with `Finetuning` objects, which are presumably a custom data type defined in the `dataherald.types` module.

## Attributes

- `storage`: An instance of a storage class that provides methods for interacting with the database.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, storage)`
The constructor takes a `storage` parameter, which is expected to be an instance of a storage class that provides the necessary database operations.

### `insert(self, model: Finetuning) -> Finetuning`
Inserts a new `Finetuning` object into the `finetunings` collection. It excludes the `id` field from the model when inserting and assigns a new `id` to the `model` after insertion. The new `id` is the string representation of the `_id` field generated by the database. It returns the `Finetuning` object with the new `id` set.

### `find_one(self, query: dict) -> Finetuning | None`
Retrieves a single `Finetuning` object from the `finetunings` collection that matches the given `query`. If no matching document is found, it returns `None`. If a document is found, it creates a `Finetuning` object with the data and sets its `id` to the string representation of the `_id` field from the database.

### `update(self, model: Finetuning) -> Finetuning`
Updates an existing `Finetuning` object in the `finetunings` collection. It uses the `id` of the `model` to locate the document in the database and updates it with the rest of the `model`'s data, excluding the `id`. It returns the updated `Finetuning` object.

### `find_by_id(self, id: str) -> Finetuning | None`
Retrieves a `Finetuning` object from the `finetunings` collection by its `id`. If no document with the given `id` is found, it returns `None`. If found, it creates a `Finetuning` object with the data and sets its `id` to the string representation of the `_id` field from the database.

### `find_by(self, query: dict, page: int = 0, limit: int = 0) -> list[Finetuning]`
Retrieves a list of `Finetuning` objects that match the given `query`. It supports pagination through the `page` and `limit` parameters. If `page` and `limit` are greater than 0, it retrieves a subset of the results based on these values. It returns a list of `Finetuning` objects with their `id` fields set to the string representation of their `_id` fields from the database.

### `find_all(self, page: int = 0, limit: int = 0) -> list[Finetuning]`
Retrieves all `Finetuning` objects from the `finetunings` collection. It supports pagination through the `page` and `limit` parameters. It returns a list of `Finetuning` objects with their `id` fields set to the string representation of their `_id` fields from the database.

### `delete_by_id(self, id: str) -> int`
Deletes a `Finetuning` object from the `finetunings` collection by its `id`. It returns the number of documents deleted (which should be 1 if the deletion was successful, or 0 if no document with the given `id` was found).

## Usage

The `FinetuningsRepository` class is used to interact with the `finetunings` collection in the database. It provides a high-level API for performing database operations on `Finetuning` objects, abstracting away the details of the database access. This class is typically used by other parts of the project that require data persistence for `Finetuning` objects, such as web service endpoints, background processing jobs, or other data management scripts.

## Dependencies

- `bson.objectid.ObjectId`: Used to convert string representations of MongoDB `_id` fields to ObjectId instances for querying.
- `dataherald.types.Finetuning`: The custom data type that this repository handles. It is assumed to be a Pydantic model or similar, with a `dict` method for serialization and an `id` attribute.

## Constants

- `DB_COLLECTION`: A string constant representing the name of the database collection this repository manages, which is `"finetunings"`.

## Notes

- The `storage` object is expected to have the following methods: `insert_one`, `find_one`, `update_or_create`, `find`, `find_all`, and `delete_by_id`, which correspond to the database operations used in the repository methods.
- The `Finetuning` type is expected to have a constructor that accepts keyword arguments corresponding to the fields of the `Finetuning` documents in the database.
- The `id` field of `Finetuning` objects is managed as a string within the application, even though it is stored as an ObjectId in the database.
