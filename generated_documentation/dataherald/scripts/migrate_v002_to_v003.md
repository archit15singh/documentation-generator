# Migration Script: migrate_v002_to_v003.py

## Overview
The `migrate_v002_to_v003.py` script is a migration utility designed to update the schema or data format in a database from version 002 to version 003 within the DataHerald project. This script is specifically focused on updating the `status` field of all documents in the `table_descriptions` collection to the value "SYNCHRONIZED".

## Dependencies
- `dataherald.config`: A module that provides access to the configuration settings of the DataHerald project.
- `dataherald.config.System`: A class that represents the system configuration and is responsible for initializing and managing system components.
- `dataherald.db.DB`: A class that provides an interface for interacting with the database.

## Execution Flow

### Entry Point
The script is executed as a standalone Python program. The entry point is the standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, which ensures that the code is only executed when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.

### Configuration and System Initialization
1. An instance of `Settings` is created from the `dataherald.config` module, which loads the necessary configuration for the migration.
2. A `System` object is instantiated with the loaded settings.
3. The `start` method of the `System` object is called to initialize the system components required for the migration.

### Database Connection
1. An instance of the `DB` class is retrieved from the `System` object, which provides the interface to interact with the database.

### Data Migration
1. The script retrieves all documents from the `table_descriptions` collection using the `find_all` method of the `storage` object (an instance of `DB`).
2. It iterates over each document (referred to as `collection_row`) in the `table_descriptions` collection.
3. For each document, the `status` field is set to the string "SYNCHRONIZED".
4. The updated document is then saved back to the database using the `update_or_create` method of the `storage` object. This method takes three arguments:
   - The name of the collection (`"table_descriptions"`).
   - A filter dictionary to identify the document to update (using the `_id` field from the current `collection_row`).
   - The updated document (`collection_row` with the modified `status` field).

## Usage
This script is intended to be run as part of a migration process when upgrading the DataHerald project from version 002 to version 003. It should be executed by a system administrator or a deployment process with the necessary permissions to modify the database.

## Notes
- The script assumes that the `table_descriptions` collection and its schema are already present in the database.
- The script does not provide rollback functionality in case of failure. It is recommended to have a database backup before running the migration.
- The script does not include error handling, so any issues during the database update process will need to be addressed manually.
- The script is specific to the DataHerald project and may not be applicable to other projects without modification.
