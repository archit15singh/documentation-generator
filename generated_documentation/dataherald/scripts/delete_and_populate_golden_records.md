# delete_and_populate_golden_records.py

## Overview
The `delete_and_populate_golden_records.py` script is designed to manage the lifecycle of "golden records" within a data management system. It performs two primary functions: deleting an existing collection of golden records and repopulating it with fresh data. This script is part of the `dataherald` project and interacts with the project's configuration, database, and vector store components.

## Dependencies
- `os`: Standard Python module to interact with the operating system.
- `dataherald.config`: Module containing configuration settings for the `dataherald` project.
- `dataherald.db`: Module providing database access functionality.
- `dataherald.types`: Module defining custom data types used within the `dataherald` project.
- `dataherald.vector_store`: Module responsible for managing vector storage within the `dataherald` project.

## Execution Flow

### Configuration and System Initialization
1. The script initializes by loading settings from the `dataherald.config.Settings` class.
2. It then creates an instance of the `System` class, passing the settings object to it.
3. The `System` instance is started, which likely initializes various components of the `dataherald` system.

### Database Connection
4. The script obtains an instance of the `DB` class from the `System` instance, which provides database access methods.

### Environment Variable Handling
5. The script retrieves the environment variable `GOLDEN_SQL_COLLECTION` or defaults to `"dataherald-staging"` if the environment variable is not set. This variable determines the name of the collection where golden records are stored.

### Golden Records Retrieval
6. The script uses the `storage.find_all("golden_sqls")` method to retrieve all golden SQL records from the database.

### Vector Store Initialization
7. An instance of `VectorStore` is obtained from the `System` instance, which is responsible for managing collections of records.

### Collection Deletion
8. The script attempts to delete the existing collection of golden records from the vector store using `vector_store.delete_collection(golden_sql_collection)`.
9. If an exception occurs during deletion, it is silently ignored (as indicated by `# noqa: S110` which suppresses linting warnings for the broad exception clause).

### Golden Records Preparation
10. The script initializes an empty list `stored_golden_sqls` to hold the golden SQL objects.
11. It iterates over each dictionary of golden SQL data retrieved from the database.
12. For each dictionary, it creates an instance of `GoldenSQL`, passing the dictionary unpacked as keyword arguments and explicitly setting the `id` attribute to the string representation of the dictionary's `_id` field.
13. Each `GoldenSQL` instance is appended to the `stored_golden_sqls` list.

### Collection Population
14. The script calls `vector_store.add_records(stored_golden_sqls, golden_sql_collection)` to add the list of `GoldenSQL` instances to the vector store under the collection name specified by `golden_sql_collection`.

## Usage
This script is intended to be run as a standalone Python script, typically as part of a data pipeline or maintenance task. It is executed by running `python delete_and_populate_golden_records.py` from the command line within the appropriate environment where the `dataherald` project and its dependencies are installed.

## Notes
- The script assumes that the necessary environment variables and system configurations are correctly set for the `dataherald` project.
- The script does not provide detailed error handling or logging for the deletion process, which may be a consideration for production environments.
- The script's functionality is tightly coupled with the `dataherald` project's internal modules and data structures, such as `GoldenSQL` and `VectorStore`.
