# Migration Script: migrate_v003_to_v004.py

## Overview
The `migrate_v003_to_v004.py` script is designed to perform data migration operations on a MongoDB database to transition from version 003 to version 004 of the data schema. The script includes operations such as renaming collections, renaming fields within documents, adding new fields to documents, and changing the datatype of specific fields.

## Dependencies
- `datetime` module for timestamping new fields.
- `bson.objectid` module for converting string representations of MongoDB ObjectIds to actual ObjectId instances.
- `dataherald.config` for accessing the project's configuration settings.
- `dataherald.db` for database operations.

## Functions

### update_object_id_fields
This function is responsible for converting string representations of MongoDB ObjectIds to actual ObjectId instances within specified fields of documents in a given collection.

#### Parameters
- `field_name` (str): The name of the field within the documents that needs to be updated.
- `collection_name` (str): The name of the collection containing the documents to be updated.

#### Process
1. Iterates over all documents in the specified collection.
2. Checks if the specified field exists and is not an empty string.
3. Converts the field value to a MongoDB ObjectId instance.
4. Updates the document in the database with the new ObjectId.

## Main Execution

### Initialization
1. A `Settings` object is created from the `dataherald.config` module.
2. A `System` object is instantiated using the settings.
3. The system is started to initialize all components.
4. An instance of the `DB` class is retrieved from the system for database operations.

### Rename Collections
1. The script attempts to rename the "nl_questions" collection to "questions".
2. The script attempts to rename the "nl_query_responses" collection to "responses".
3. If any exception occurs during the renaming process, it is silently ignored.

### Rename Fields
1. The "nl_question_id" field in the "responses" collection is renamed to "question_id".
2. The "nl_response" field in the "responses" collection is renamed to "response".

### Add Field
1. Iterates over all documents in the "responses" collection.
2. Checks if the "created_at" field does not exist in the document.
3. If the field does not exist, it is added with the current datetime as its value.
4. The document is updated in the database with the new "created_at" field.

### Change Datatype
1. The `update_object_id_fields` function is called with the appropriate field and collection names to convert string representations of ObjectIds to ObjectId instances for the following collections and fields:
   - "db_connection_id" field in the "table_descriptions" collection.
   - "db_connection_id" field in the "golden_records" collection.
   - "db_connection_id" field in the "questions" collection.
   - "db_connection_id" field in the "instructions" collection.
   - "question_id" field in the "responses" collection.

## Usage
This script is intended to be run as a standalone Python script during the migration process. It should be executed when upgrading the data schema from version 003 to version 004. The script should be run with appropriate database access permissions and environment configurations set to ensure it can perform the necessary database operations.
