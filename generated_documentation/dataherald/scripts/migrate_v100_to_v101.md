# Migration Script: migrate_v100_to_v101.py

## Overview
The `migrate_v100_to_v101.py` script is designed to perform a data migration on a collection named `database_connections` within a database managed by the `dataherald` system. The script updates the schema of the `database_connections` collection from version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 by renaming a field and re-encrypting connection URIs for entries that use SSH.

## Dependencies
- `dataherald.config`: Provides access to the configuration settings of the `dataherald` system.
- `dataherald.db`: Contains the `DB` class responsible for database operations.
- `dataherald.utils.encrypt`: Contains the `FernetEncrypt` class used for encryption and decryption of sensitive data.

## Execution Flow

### System Initialization
1. The script initializes by loading the settings from `dataherald.config.Settings`.
2. It then creates a `System` instance using the loaded settings.
3. The `System` instance is started, which likely initializes the necessary components for the migration.

### Database Connection
4. The script retrieves an instance of the `DB` class from the `System` instance, which is used to interact with the database.

### Field Renaming
5. The `rename_field` method of the `storage` object (an instance of `DB`) is called to rename the field `uri` to `connection_uri` in the `database_connections` collection.

### Data Encryption and Update
6. The script creates an instance of `FernetEncrypt` to handle encryption tasks.
7. It then queries the `database_connections` collection for documents where the `use_ssh` field is `True`.
8. For each database connection retrieved:
   - The script checks if the `db_driver` field is missing in the `ssh_settings` sub-document and if the `connection_uri` is not empty or `None`.
   - If the above condition is met, the script continues to the next iteration without making changes.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a new URI using the decrypted `remote_db_password` from the `ssh_settings` and other SSH-related fields.
   - The new URI is then encrypted using `FernetEncrypt` and assigned to the `connection_uri` field of the database connection document.
   - The `ssh_settings` sub-document is updated with only the necessary fields: `host`, `username`, `password`, and `private_key_password`.

### Database Update
9. The script updates the existing document in the `database_connections` collection with the new `connection_uri` and modified `ssh_settings` using the `update_or_create` method of the `storage` object. The document is identified by its `_id`.

## Usage
This script is intended to be run as a standalone Python script during the migration process from version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 of the `dataherald` system. It should be executed by a system administrator or a migration tool that handles version upgrades. The script is executed without any command-line arguments and assumes that the `dataherald` system is properly configured and operational.

## Important Notes
- The script assumes that the `dataherald` system's configuration is set up correctly and that the database is accessible.
- The script does not handle exceptions explicitly, so any issues during the migration process (e.g., database connectivity problems, encryption errors) will result in an unhandled exception.
- The script should be used with caution, as it modifies the database schema and data. It is recommended to perform a backup of the `database_connections` collection before running the script.
- The script does not provide rollback functionality in case the migration needs to be reversed.
