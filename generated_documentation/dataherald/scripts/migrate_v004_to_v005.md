# Migration Script: migrate_v004_to_v005.py

## Overview
The `migrate_v004_to_v005.py` script is a migration utility designed to update the structure of database connection records within a project that uses the `dataherald` framework. This script is specifically tailored to transition from version 0.0.4 to version 0.0.5 of the data model.

## Dependencies
- `dataherald.config`: Module that provides access to the configuration settings of the `dataherald` framework.
- `dataherald.db`: Module that provides database interaction capabilities.

## Execution Context
This script is intended to be executed as a standalone Python script. It is designed to be run manually by a system administrator or automatically by a migration system when upgrading the `dataherald` framework from an older version to a newer one.

## Process Flow

### Configuration and System Initialization
1. The script starts by importing necessary modules and classes from the `dataherald` framework.
2. It then initializes the `Settings` object from the `dataherald.config` module, which loads the configuration settings for the current environment.
3. A `System` object is instantiated with the loaded settings, which acts as a central point for managing different components of the `dataherald` framework.
4. The `System` object is started, which likely involves initializing connections and preparing the environment for operation.

### Database Connection and Migration
5. The script retrieves an instance of the `DB` class from the `System` object. This `DB` instance is responsible for database operations.
6. It then iterates over all records in the "database_connections" collection (or equivalent storage) using the `find_all` method of the `DB` instance.
7. For each database connection record found:
   - The script checks if the record contains the "llm_credentials" key and if it is not empty.
   - If the condition is met, it extracts the "api_key" from the "llm_credentials" sub-document and assigns it to a new key in the record called "llm_api_key".
   - The "llm_credentials" key is then set to `None`, effectively removing the credentials from the original location in the record.
   - The updated record is then saved back to the "database_connections" collection using the `update_or_create` method of the `DB` instance. This method ensures that the record is updated if it exists or created if it does not.

### Usage
- The script is executed from the command line by navigating to the directory containing the script and running `python migrate_v004_to_v005.py`.
- It does not take any command-line arguments and operates on the database connections as per the logic defined in the script.

## Post-Migration
After the script has been executed, all database connection records in the "database_connections" collection should have their "llm_credentials" migrated to a new "llm_api_key" field, with the original "llm_credentials" field being cleared. This change reflects a structural update in the data model between versions 0.0.4 and 0.0.5 of the `dataherald` framework.

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly include error handling. It is assumed that the `dataherald` framework's underlying methods (`start`, `instance`, `find_all`, `update_or_create`) include their own error handling mechanisms. In a production environment, additional error handling and logging should be implemented to ensure smooth migration and to capture any issues that may arise during the process.
