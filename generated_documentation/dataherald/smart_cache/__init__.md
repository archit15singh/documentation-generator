# SmartCache Module

## Overview

The `SmartCache` module, located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/smart_cache/__init__.py`, provides an abstract base class for implementing various caching mechanisms within the project. This module is part of the `dataherald` package and is designed to be extended by concrete cache classes that implement the specified abstract methods.

## Dependencies

- `abc`: The module uses the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module to define the `SmartCache` as an abstract base class.
- `typing`: The `Any` and `Union` types from the `typing` module are used for type hinting.
- `dataherald.config`: The `Component` class is imported from the `dataherald.config` module, which `SmartCache` inherits from.
- `dataherald.types`: The `Response` type is imported from the `dataherald.types` module and is used in the type hinting of the `add` method.

## SmartCache Class

### Description

The `SmartCache` class serves as a base class for all cache implementations within the project. It inherits from both `Component` and `ABC`, indicating that it is a configurable component that must be subclassed to create a usable cache object. The class defines the structure and expected behavior of cache objects through abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

### Methods

#### `add`

```python
@abstractmethod
def add(self, key: str, value: Response) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Adds a key-value pair to the cache."""
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `key` (`str`): The key under which the value should be stored in the cache.
  - `value` (`Response`): The value to be stored in the cache, where `Response` is a type defined in the `dataherald.types` module.
- **Returns**: A dictionary (`dict[str, Any]`) that may contain metadata or status information about the operation.
- **Description**: This method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It is intended to add a key-value pair to the cache. The actual implementation will depend on the specific caching strategy used by the subclass.

#### `lookup`

```python
@abstractmethod
def lookup(self, key: str) -> str:
    """Looks up a key in the cache."""
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `key` (`str`): The key to look up in the cache.
- **Returns**: A string (`str`) representing the cached value associated with the provided key.
- **Description**: This method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It is intended to retrieve a value from the cache based on the provided key. The actual implementation will depend on the specific caching strategy used by the subclass.

## Usage

The `SmartCache` class is not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, it provides a template for creating concrete cache classes that implement the `add` and `lookup` methods. These concrete classes will provide the actual caching functionality, such as storing data in memory, on disk, or in a distributed cache system.

Subclasses must override the abstract methods with concrete implementations that handle the addition and retrieval of data from the cache. Once implemented, these cache classes can be used throughout the project to improve performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.

## Example

Below is a hypothetical example of a subclass that implements the `SmartCache` abstract methods:

```python
class MemoryCache(SmartCache):
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = {}

    def add(self, key: str, value: Response) -> dict[str, Any]:
        self._cache[key] = value
        return {"status": "success"}

    def lookup(self, key: str) -> str:
        return self._cache.get(key, "Not Found")
```

In this example, `MemoryCache` is a simple in-memory cache that stores key-value pairs in a Python dictionary. The `add` method adds the key-value pair to the dictionary, and the `lookup` method retrieves the value associated with the key, returning "Not Found" if the key does not exist in the cache.
