# Query Class

## Overview

The `Query` class is a Python class that inherits from `BaseModel`, which is provided by the `pydantic` library. This class is designed to represent a query with specific attributes that can be used within the `dataherald` API. The `pydantic` library is used for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

## Attributes

The `Query` class defines the following attributes:

- `max_rows`: An integer that specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned by the query. It has a default value of 100, which means if the `max_rows` is not explicitly provided, the query will return up to 100 rows.
- `metadata`: A dictionary that can hold additional metadata related to the query. This attribute is optional and can be `None`. The `|` symbol is a type union operator introduced in Python 3.10, which indicates that `metadata` can be either a `dict` or `None`.

## Usage

The `Query` class is typically used to create query objects that can be passed around within the `dataherald` project. These objects encapsulate the query parameters and ensure that they adhere to the defined schema and validation rules set by `pydantic`.

### Instantiation

To create an instance of the `Query` class, you can simply instantiate it with the desired attributes:

```python
query_instance = Query(max_rows=50, metadata={'user': 'admin', 'priority': 'high'})
```

If you do not provide the `max_rows` argument, it will default to 100:

```python
query_instance = Query(metadata={'user': 'admin', 'priority': 'high'})
```

### Validation

When an instance of the `Query` class is created, `pydantic` performs validation on the provided data:

- It checks that `max_rows` is an integer.
- It ensures that `metadata`, if provided, is a dictionary.

If the validation fails, `pydantic` raises a `ValidationError` with details about what went wrong.

### Accessing Attributes

Once a `Query` object is instantiated, you can access its attributes using the dot notation:

```python
print(query_instance.max_rows)  # Outputs the value of max_rows
print(query_instance.metadata)  # Outputs the metadata dictionary or None if not provided
```

### Serialization

`Query` objects can be serialized to JSON or other formats supported by `pydantic`. This is useful when you need to send the query data over HTTP or store it in a file:

```python
json_representation = query_instance.json()
```

### Integration with API Endpoints

In the context of the `dataherald` API, `Query` objects can be used as request models for API endpoints that require query parameters. For example, an endpoint that retrieves data based on a query could accept a `Query` object as input, ensuring that all incoming query data is valid and conforms to the expected structure.

## File Location

The `Query` class is defined in the file located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/api/types/query.py` within the project's directory structure. This location suggests that the class is part of the API's type definitions, specifically related to querying functionality in the `dataherald` project.
