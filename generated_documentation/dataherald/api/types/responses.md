# Responses Module Documentation

## Overview
The `responses.py` module within the `dataherald/api/types` directory defines a set of response classes that are used to structure the data returned by the API endpoints of the DataHerald project. These classes are built using Pydantic's `BaseModel` to ensure type validation and serialization. The module also includes custom validators to handle specific data formatting.

## Dependencies
- `datetime`: Provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
- `pytz`: Brings support for the Olson timezone database, allowing accurate and cross-platform timezone calculations.
- `pydantic`: A data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations.
- `dataherald.db_scanner.models.types`: Contains the `TableDescription` class definition.
- `dataherald.sql_database.models.types`: Contains the `DatabaseConnection` class definition.
- `dataherald.types`: Contains the `GoldenSQL` and `LLMConfig` class definitions.

## Classes

### BaseResponse
The `BaseResponse` class is a foundational response class that includes common attributes for all response types.

#### Attributes:
- `id`: A `str` representing a unique identifier for the response.
- `metadata`: An optional `dict` that can store additional information related to the response.
- `created_at`: An optional `str` representing the creation time of the response.

#### Validators:
- `created_at_as_string`: Ensures that the `created_at` attribute, if present, is serialized as a string in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone.

### PromptResponse
The `PromptResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and is used to represent responses related to prompts.

#### Attributes:
- `text`: A `str` containing the prompt text.
- `db_connection_id`: A `str` representing the identifier of the database connection associated with the prompt.

### SQLGenerationResponse
The `SQLGenerationResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and is used to represent responses related to SQL generation tasks.

#### Attributes:
- `prompt_id`: A `str` representing the identifier of the associated prompt.
- `finetuning_id`: An optional `str` representing the identifier of the finetuning process.
- `status`: A `str` indicating the status of the SQL generation task.
- `completed_at`: An optional `str` representing the completion time of the task.
- `llm_config`: An optional `LLMConfig` instance containing configuration for the language model.
- `sql`: An optional `str` containing the generated SQL query.
- `tokens_used`: An optional `int` indicating the number of tokens used by the language model.
- `confidence_score`: An optional `float` representing the confidence score of the generated SQL.
- `error`: An optional `str` containing error information if the task failed.

#### Validators:
- `completed_at_as_string`: Ensures that the `completed_at` attribute, if present, is serialized as a string in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone.

### NLGenerationResponse
The `NLGenerationResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and is used to represent responses related to natural language generation tasks.

#### Attributes:
- `llm_config`: An optional `LLMConfig` instance containing configuration for the language model.
- `sql_generation_id`: A `str` representing the identifier of the associated SQL generation task.
- `text`: An optional `str` containing the generated natural language text.

### InstructionResponse
The `InstructionResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and is used to represent responses related to instructions.

#### Attributes:
- `instruction`: A `str` containing the instruction text.
- `db_connection_id`: A `str` representing the identifier of the database connection associated with the instruction.

### DatabaseConnectionResponse
The `DatabaseConnectionResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and `DatabaseConnection` and is used to represent responses related to database connections.

### TableDescriptionResponse
The `TableDescriptionResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and `TableDescription` and is used to represent responses related to table descriptions.

#### Attributes:
- `id`: An optional `str` representing a unique identifier for the table description.

### GoldenSQLResponse
The `GoldenSQLResponse` class extends `BaseResponse` and `GoldenSQL` and is used to represent responses related to golden SQL queries.

## Usage
These response classes are typically instantiated with data retrieved from the database or generated by the application's logic. They are then serialized to JSON format and sent as HTTP responses to API clients. The validators ensure that timestamps are consistently formatted, and the inheritance from `BaseModel` ensures that all other data types are correctly validated and serialized.
