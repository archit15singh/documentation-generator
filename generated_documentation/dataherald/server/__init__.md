# Server Module

## Overview

The `Server` module, located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/server/__init__.py`, defines an abstract base class that serves as a blueprint for server implementations within the `dataherald` project. This module is part of the `dataherald` package, which is assumed to be a data processing or data serving application.

## Dependencies

- `abc`: The `abc` module from the Python standard library provides facilities for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).
- `dataherald.config`: This is a custom module within the `dataherald` package that presumably contains configuration settings, including the `Settings` class.

## Server Class

### Description

The `Server` class is an abstract base class that outlines the required interface for server objects within the `dataherald` project. It enforces that all subclasses must implement the specified abstract methods and properties.

### Attributes

The `Server` class does not define any concrete attributes. It is designed to be subclassed by concrete server implementations that will provide the necessary attributes based on the specific server's requirements.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self, settings: Settings)`

- **Description**: This is an abstract method that serves as the constructor for the `Server` class. It is meant to be overridden by subclasses, which should provide their own initialization logic.
- **Parameters**:
  - `settings` (`Settings`): An instance of the `Settings` class from the `dataherald.config` module. This parameter is expected to contain configuration settings relevant to the server's operation.
- **Returns**: None. As an abstract method, it does not contain any implementation. Subclasses are responsible for providing the implementation.

### Usage

The `Server` class is not meant to be instantiated directly due to its abstract nature. Instead, it should be subclassed by concrete server classes that implement the `__init__` method and any other server-specific functionality.

Concrete subclasses must provide an implementation for the `__init__` method that accepts a `Settings` object and performs any necessary initialization for the server.

Example of subclassing the `Server` class:

```python
from dataherald.server import Server
from dataherald.config import Settings

class ConcreteServer(Server):
    def __init__(self, settings: Settings):
        # Implement initialization logic specific to ConcreteServer
        self.port = settings.port
        self.host = settings.host
        # Additional initialization code as required

# Usage of the ConcreteServer class
settings = Settings(port=8080, host='localhost')
server = ConcreteServer(settings)
```

In the above example, `ConcreteServer` is a hypothetical implementation of the `Server` class that initializes server-specific settings such as `port` and `host`.

## Notes

- The `Server` class is part of a larger project structure and is expected to interact with other components within the `dataherald` package.
- The actual server logic, such as starting and stopping the server, handling requests, and other server-related tasks, is not defined in this abstract class and must be implemented by the subclasses.
- The `Settings` class is assumed to be a custom class that encapsulates configuration settings. The structure and attributes of the `Settings` class are not detailed in this documentation and should be referred to in the `dataherald.config` module documentation.
