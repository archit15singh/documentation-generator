# SimpleEvaluator Class

## Overview

`SimpleEvaluator` is a subclass of `Evaluator` that provides functionality to evaluate the correctness of SQL queries generated in response to user questions. It leverages a language model chain (`LLMChain`) to analyze SQL queries and assign a score based on their accuracy and adherence to best practices.

## Attributes

- `llm`: An instance of a language model chain used for evaluating SQL queries.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, system: System)`

Constructor for the `SimpleEvaluator` class.

#### Parameters

- `system`: An instance of `System` containing the configuration and components of the project.

#### Behavior

- Initializes the `SimpleEvaluator` instance by calling the superclass constructor and setting the `system` attribute.

### `answer_parser(self, answer: str) -> int`

Parses the evaluator's textual answer to extract a numerical score.

#### Parameters

- `answer`: A string containing the evaluator's response.

#### Returns

- An integer score between 0 and 100.

#### Behavior

- Searches for a pattern "Score: <number>" in the answer.
- If the pattern is found, returns the number as an integer.
- If the pattern is not found, searches for the last number in the answer that is between 0 and 100.
- If no number is found, returns 0.

### `evaluate(self, user_prompt: Prompt, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> Evaluation`

Evaluates the correctness of a SQL query generated in response to a user prompt.

#### Parameters

- `user_prompt`: An instance of `Prompt` representing the user's question.
- `sql_generation`: An instance of `SQLGeneration` containing the generated SQL query.
- `database_connection`: An instance of `DatabaseConnection` representing the database connection details.

#### Returns

- An instance of `Evaluation` containing the question ID, answer ID, and the calculated score.

#### Behavior

- Retrieves the SQL engine for the given database connection.
- Logs the start of the evaluation process.
- Retrieves the table descriptions from the database using `TableDescriptionRepository`.
- Initializes the language model chain with the appropriate configuration.
- Parses the SQL query to extract table names.
- Constructs the schema description for the tables involved in the SQL query.
- Checks if the SQL query is marked as "INVALID" and returns a score of 0 if so.
- Executes the SQL query against the database and fetches the results.
- Converts the query results into a format suitable for the language model evaluation.
- Invokes the language model chain with the constructed prompt, including the dialect, question, SQL query, and results.
- Parses the language model's textual response to extract the score.
- Logs the score and the time taken for the evaluation.
- Returns the `Evaluation` instance with the calculated score.

## Usage

The `SimpleEvaluator` class is used within the project to evaluate the accuracy of SQL queries generated by the system. It is instantiated with the system configuration and then called upon to evaluate SQL queries using the `evaluate` method. The evaluation process involves parsing the SQL query, executing it against the database, and using a language model to analyze the query and results. The evaluator assigns a score based on the analysis and returns it as part of an `Evaluation` object.
