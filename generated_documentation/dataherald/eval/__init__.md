# `dataherald/eval/__init__.py` Module

## Overview

This module defines the abstract base class `Evaluator` and the `Evaluation` data model used within the `dataherald` project. The `Evaluator` class is designed to assess the quality of SQL queries generated in response to user prompts. It is part of a larger system that involves natural language processing and SQL generation.

## Classes

### `Evaluation`

The `Evaluation` class is a Pydantic model that represents the result of evaluating a generated SQL query against a user prompt. It includes the following fields:

- `id`: An optional string that serves as a unique identifier for the evaluation instance. It is aliased to `_id` in the underlying data.
- `question_id`: An optional string that represents the identifier of the user's question. It is aliased to `q_id`.
- `answer_id`: An optional string that represents the identifier of the generated answer. It is aliased to `a_id`.
- `score`: A floating-point number constrained between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that represents the confidence score of the evaluation. The default value is set to 0.5.

### `Evaluator`

The `Evaluator` class is an abstract base class that inherits from both `Component` and `ABC` (Abstract Base Class). It is designed to evaluate SQL queries generated in response to user prompts. The class contains the following attributes and methods:

#### Attributes

- `database`: An instance of `SQLDatabase` that represents the database where the SQL queries will be executed.
- `acceptance_threshold`: A floating-point number constrained between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that defines the threshold for accepting a generated SQL query as valid. The default value is set to 0.8.
- `llm_config`: An instance of `LLMConfig` that holds the configuration for the language learning model.
- `llm`: An optional instance of `ChatModel` that represents the language learning model used for generating SQL queries. It is initialized to `None`.

#### Constructor

- `__init__(self, system: System)`: The constructor initializes the `Evaluator` with a reference to the `System` object and creates an instance of `ChatModel` using the system configuration.

#### Methods

- `get_confidence_score(self, user_prompt: Prompt, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> confloat`: This method calculates the confidence score of a generated SQL query by calling the `evaluate` method. It returns a floating-point number representing the confidence score.

- `evaluate(self, user_prompt: Prompt, sql_generation: SQLGeneration, database_connection: DatabaseConnection) -> Evaluation`: This is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It evaluates the generated SQL query against the user prompt and returns an `Evaluation` object.

## Usage

The `Evaluator` class is intended to be subclassed by concrete evaluator implementations that define the `evaluate` method. These implementations will use the `evaluate` method to assess the quality of SQL queries generated in response to user prompts. The `get_confidence_score` method can be used to retrieve the confidence score of the evaluation, which can then be compared against the `acceptance_threshold` to determine if the generated SQL query is acceptable.

The `Evaluation` class is used to encapsulate the results of the evaluation process, including the unique identifiers for the question and answer, as well as the confidence score of the evaluation.

## Integration

The `Evaluator` class is part of a larger system that involves components for natural language processing, SQL generation, and database interaction. It is designed to work within the `dataherald` project's infrastructure, which includes configuration management (`LLMConfig`), database models (`SQLDatabase`, `DatabaseConnection`), and a chat model (`ChatModel`).

The module is located at `/workspaces/documentation-generator/target_code/dataherald/eval/__init__.py` within the project's directory structure.
