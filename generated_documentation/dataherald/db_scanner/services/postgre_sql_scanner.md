# PostgreSqlScanner Class

## Overview

The `PostgreSqlScanner` class is a Python class that extends the `AbstractScanner` class, providing specific implementations for scanning PostgreSQL databases. It is part of the `dataherald.db_scanner.services` module within the `dataherald` project. This class is used to interact with PostgreSQL databases to retrieve metadata and statistics about the database tables and columns.

## Attributes

- `MIN_CATEGORY_VALUE`: An integer constant set to `1`, representing the minimum threshold for the distinct count of values in a column to be considered for further processing.
- `MAX_CATEGORY_VALUE`: An integer constant set to `100`, representing the maximum threshold for the distinct count of values in a column to be considered for further processing.

## Methods

### cardinality_values

```python
def cardinality_values(self, column: Column, db_engine: SQLDatabase) -> list | None
```

#### Description

The `cardinality_values` method is used to retrieve the cardinality statistics of a given column from a PostgreSQL database. It returns the most common values of the column if the number of distinct values falls within the defined range (`MIN_CATEGORY_VALUE` and `MAX_CATEGORY_VALUE`).

#### Parameters

- `column`: An instance of `sqlalchemy.sql.schema.Column`, representing the database column for which the cardinality statistics are to be retrieved.
- `db_engine`: An instance of `dataherald.sql_database.base.SQLDatabase`, representing the database engine used to execute the query.

#### Returns

- A list of the most common values for the column if the number of distinct values is within the specified range.
- `None` if the number of distinct values is outside the specified range or if no results are found.

#### Implementation Details

- The method executes a raw SQL query on the PostgreSQL database using the `db_engine.engine.execute` method.
- The query retrieves the number of distinct values (`n_distinct`) and the most common values (`most_common_vals`) from the `pg_catalog.pg_stats` system catalog for the specified column.
- The query results are fetched using the `.fetchall()` method.
- The method checks if the result set is not empty and if the `n_distinct` value is within the specified range.
- If the conditions are met, the method returns the `most_common_vals` as a list.
- The method uses a raw SQL string with string interpolation, which could be a potential security risk (SQL injection) if not handled properly. The `# noqa: S608 E501` comments indicate that the linter should ignore the potential security risk and line length issues.

### get_logs

```python
def get_logs(self, table: str, db_engine: SQLDatabase, db_connection_id: str) -> list[QueryHistory]
```

#### Description

The `get_logs` method is a stub implementation that currently returns an empty list. It is intended to retrieve a list of query history logs for a given table from the PostgreSQL database. However, the actual implementation is not provided in the input code.

#### Parameters

- `table`: A string representing the name of the database table for which the query history logs are to be retrieved.
- `db_engine`: An instance of `dataherald.sql_database.base.SQLDatabase`, representing the database engine used to execute the query.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the identifier for the database connection.

#### Returns

- An empty list of `QueryHistory` objects, indicating that the method has not been implemented yet.

#### Implementation Details

- The method is currently a placeholder and does not perform any database operations.
- The `# noqa: ARG002` comment indicates that the linter should ignore the argument naming convention issue.

## Usage

The `PostgreSqlScanner` class is intended to be used within the `dataherald` project to scan PostgreSQL databases for metadata and statistics. It can be instantiated and used by other components that require information about the cardinality of database columns or query history logs. The actual usage of the `get_logs` method will depend on its future implementation.

## Inheritance

The `PostgreSqlScanner` class inherits from the `AbstractScanner` class, which defines the interface for database scanners. The `@override` decorator is used to indicate that the methods `cardinality_values` and `get_logs` override the abstract methods defined in the parent class.
