# ClickHouseScanner Class

## Overview

`ClickHouseScanner` is a Python class that extends the `AbstractScanner` class, providing specific implementations for scanning and analyzing ClickHouse databases. It is part of the `dataherald.db_scanner.services` module within the `dataherald` project. The class is designed to interact with a ClickHouse database using SQLAlchemy to perform operations such as estimating the cardinality of values in a column and retrieving logs.

## Constants

- `MIN_CATEGORY_VALUE`: The minimum value used to determine if a column's cardinality is within an acceptable range for distinct value retrieval.
- `MAX_CATEGORY_VALUE`: The maximum value used to determine if a column's cardinality is within an acceptable range for distinct value retrieval.
- `MAX_LOGS`: The maximum number of logs to retrieve from the database.

## Methods

### cardinality_values

#### Signature

```python
def cardinality_values(self, column: Column, db_engine: SQLDatabase) -> list | None
```

#### Description

Estimates the cardinality (the number of distinct values) of a specified column in a ClickHouse database and retrieves the distinct values if the cardinality is within a specified range.

#### Parameters

- `column`: An instance of `sqlalchemy.sql.schema.Column` representing the database column for which to estimate cardinality.
- `db_engine`: An instance of `dataherald.sql_database.base.SQLDatabase` representing the database engine to use for executing the query.

#### Returns

- A list of strings representing the distinct values in the column if the cardinality is within the specified range (`MIN_CATEGORY_VALUE` < cardinality <= `MAX_CATEGORY_VALUE`).
- `None` if the cardinality is not within the specified range.

#### Implementation Details

1. A SQL query is constructed using SQLAlchemy's `select` and `func.uniqHLL12` functions to estimate the cardinality of the specified column.
2. The query is executed against the ClickHouse database using the provided `db_engine`.
3. The result set is fetched and checked to ensure that at least one row with one field is returned and that the cardinality is within the specified range.
4. If the conditions are met, a second query is constructed to retrieve up to 101 distinct values from the column using `func.distinct` and `limit`.
5. The distinct values are fetched from the database, and a list of these values is returned.

### get_logs

#### Signature

```python
def get_logs(self, table: str, db_engine: SQLDatabase, db_connection_id: str) -> list[QueryHistory]
```

#### Description

This method is intended to retrieve logs from a specified table in a ClickHouse database. However, the current implementation returns an empty list and does not perform any database operations.

#### Parameters

- `table`: A string representing the name of the database table from which to retrieve logs.
- `db_engine`: An instance of `dataherald.sql_database.base.SQLDatabase` representing the database engine to use for executing the query.
- `db_connection_id`: A string representing the identifier for the database connection.

#### Returns

- An empty list of `QueryHistory` objects, indicating no logs are retrieved.

#### Implementation Details

The method is currently a stub and does not contain any logic to perform the intended operation. It is likely a placeholder for future implementation or may require subclassing to provide the specific log retrieval functionality.

## Usage

The `ClickHouseScanner` class is used within the `dataherald` project to perform database scanning operations specific to ClickHouse databases. It is instantiated and utilized by other components that require information about the cardinality of database columns or need to retrieve logs for analysis or monitoring purposes. The class relies on SQLAlchemy for database interaction, ensuring compatibility with the ClickHouse dialect and SQL syntax.

## Dependencies

- `sqlalchemy`: Used for constructing and executing SQL queries.
- `overrides`: Used for the `@override` decorator to ensure methods are correctly overriding abstract methods from the parent class.
- `dataherald.db_scanner.models.types`: Contains the `QueryHistory` model used in the `get_logs` method.
- `dataherald.db_scanner.services.abstract_scanner`: Contains the `AbstractScanner` class that `ClickHouseScanner` extends.
- `dataherald.sql_database.base`: Contains the `SQLDatabase` class used for database engine interaction.
