# `__init__.py` in `db_scanner/repository` Module

## Overview

The `__init__.py` file within the `db_scanner/repository` directory serves as an initializer for the `repository` package in the `db_scanner` module of the `dataherald` project. This file can be used to expose specific classes, functions, or variables from within the package, making them directly accessible when the package is imported elsewhere in the project.

## Usage

When the `repository` package is imported, Python will execute the `__init__.py` file. The contents of this file determine which components of the `repository` package are available to the importer. This can include importing classes or functions from submodules for easier access, initializing package-level variables, or performing any startup configuration necessary for the package to function correctly.

## Structure and Content

The `__init__.py` file can contain several types of statements and definitions:

1. **Import Statements**: These statements import classes, functions, or variables from submodules within the `repository` package. This allows users to access these components directly from the `repository` package without having to import them from their respective submodules.

    ```python
    from .submodule import SomeClass, some_function
    ```

2. **Package Initialization Code**: Any code that needs to run when the package is first imported can be placed here. This could include setting up logging, initializing connections to databases, or preparing any necessary resources.

    ```python
    # Example initialization code
    setup_logging()
    initialize_database_connection()
    ```

3. **__all__ Variable**: This is a list of strings defining what symbols the package will export when `from repository import *` is used. It controls which names are public and should be used with caution to avoid polluting the namespace.

    ```python
    __all__ = ['SomeClass', 'some_function', 'ANOTHER_CONSTANT']
    ```

4. **Package-Level Variables or Constants**: These are variables or constants that are meant to be used across multiple modules within the `repository` package.

    ```python
    ANOTHER_CONSTANT = 42
    ```

## Example

Below is an example of what the `__init__.py` file might contain:

```python
# Import specific classes from submodules for easier access
from .user_repository import UserRepository
from .product_repository import ProductRepository

# Initialize package-level constants
DEFAULT_CONNECTION_STRING = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname"

# Define what is available to importers using the wildcard import
__all__ = ['UserRepository', 'ProductRepository', 'connect_to_database']

# Define a function to establish a database connection
def connect_to_database(connection_string=DEFAULT_CONNECTION_STRING):
    # Logic to connect to the database
    pass

# Perform any necessary package initialization
connect_to_database()
```

In this example, when the `repository` package is imported, `UserRepository` and `ProductRepository` classes are directly accessible, and the `connect_to_database` function is available for establishing a database connection with a default or provided connection string. The `__all__` list specifies that only these classes and the `connect_to_database` function are intended for public use when importing with `*`.
