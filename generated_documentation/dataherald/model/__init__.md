# LLMModel Class

## Overview

The `LLMModel` class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for language model components within the `dataherald` project. It inherits from the `Component` class, which is likely a part of the project's configuration management, and from the abstract base class `ABC` from Python's `abc` module, which is used to create abstract classes.

## Attributes

- `model`: This attribute is intended to store the actual language model instance. Its type is not specified and is represented by the `Any` type hint, indicating that it can be any type of object.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, system: System)`

The constructor method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. It initializes the `LLMModel` instance with a `system` object, which is an instance of the `System` class from the `dataherald.config` module. The `system` object likely contains configuration or state information relevant to the system in which the model operates.

#### Parameters

- `system`: An instance of the `System` class, representing the system configuration or state.

### `get_model(self, database_connection: DatabaseConnection, model_family="openai", model_name="gpt-4-turbo-preview", api_base: str | None = None, **kwargs: Any) -> Any`

This abstract method is intended to be implemented by subclasses to provide a mechanism for retrieving or initializing the language model. The method signature suggests that the model may be fetched or created based on parameters such as a database connection, model family, model name, and an optional API base URL.

#### Parameters

- `database_connection`: An instance of `DatabaseConnection` from the `dataherald.sql_database.models.types` module, which likely encapsulates the details required to connect to a database where model-related data might be stored or retrieved.
- `model_family`: A string defaulting to `"openai"`, which specifies the family or type of language model to be used.
- `model_name`: A string defaulting to `"gpt-4-turbo-preview"`, which specifies the particular model within the model family.
- `api_base`: An optional string or `None` that specifies the base URL of the API that might be used to interact with the language model. This parameter is optional and defaults to `None`.
- `**kwargs`: A variable number of keyword arguments that allow for additional parameters to be passed to the method, providing flexibility for subclasses to require more specific configuration options.

#### Returns

- The method returns an instance of the language model, the type of which is unspecified and represented by the `Any` type hint.

## Usage

As an abstract class, `LLMModel` cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a template for subclasses that must implement the abstract methods defined in `LLMModel`. These subclasses will provide concrete implementations for initializing the model and retrieving it, potentially involving interactions with a database and/or an external API.

Subclasses of `LLMModel` are likely to be components within the `dataherald` project that are responsible for managing different types of language models, such as those provided by OpenAI or other providers. The `LLMModel` interface ensures that all such components adhere to a consistent API, making it easier to integrate and swap different language model implementations within the project.
