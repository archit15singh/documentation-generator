# ChatModel Class

## Overview

The `ChatModel` class is a subclass of `LLMModel` and is responsible for creating instances of chat models from various providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Cohere. It is designed to be used within a project that requires interaction with language models for chat or conversational purposes.

## Attributes

The `ChatModel` class does not define any additional attributes beyond those inherited from its superclass `LLMModel`.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, system)`

The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `ChatModel` class.

#### Parameters

- `system`: The system configuration or context in which the model will be used.

#### Behavior

- Calls the constructor of the superclass `LLMModel` with the provided `system` argument.

### `get_model(self, database_connection, model_family="openai", model_name="gpt-4-turbo-preview", api_base=None, **kwargs) -> Any`

The `get_model` method is responsible for creating and returning an instance of a chat model based on the specified `model_family`.

#### Parameters

- `database_connection` (`DatabaseConnection`): An object representing the database connection, which is used to decrypt the API key required to authenticate with the model provider's API.
- `model_family` (`str`, optional): A string indicating the family of the chat model to be used. Defaults to `"openai"`.
- `model_name` (`str`, optional): The name of the specific model to be instantiated. Defaults to `"gpt-4-turbo-preview"`.
- `api_base` (`str | None`, optional): The base URL for the API of the model provider. Defaults to `None`.
- `**kwargs` (`Any`): Additional keyword arguments that may be required for initializing the chat model.

#### Behavior

- Decrypts the API key using the `decrypt_api_key` method of the `database_connection` object.
- Depending on the value of `model_family`, it creates an instance of the corresponding chat model class:
  - `ChatOpenAI`: If `model_family` is `"openai"`.
  - `ChatAnthropic`: If `model_family` is `"anthropic"`.
  - `ChatGooglePalm`: If `model_family` is `"google"`.
  - `ChatCohere`: If `model_family` is `"cohere"`.
- Each chat model class is initialized with the `model_name`, the decrypted API key, and any additional keyword arguments provided in `**kwargs`.
- If the `api_base` is provided, it is passed to the `ChatOpenAI` class constructor.
- If the `model_family` does not match any of the expected values, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "No valid API key environment variable found".

#### Returns

- An instance of the chat model corresponding to the specified `model_family`.

## Usage

The `ChatModel` class is used in a project where a chat or conversational model is needed. It abstracts the details of creating instances of different chat models and handles the decryption of API keys securely. The class is designed to be flexible, allowing the user to specify the model family, model name, and any additional parameters required for the chat model initialization.

## Example

```python
# Assuming `database_connection` is an instance of `DatabaseConnection`
chat_model_instance = ChatModel(system)
chat_model = chat_model_instance.get_model(
    database_connection=database_connection,
    model_family="openai",
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    temperature=0.7
)
```

In the above example, a `ChatModel` instance is created, and the `get_model` method is called to create an instance of `ChatOpenAI` with the model name `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` and a temperature setting of `0.7`.
```
