# BaseModel Class

## Overview

The `BaseModel` class is a subclass of `LLMModel` and is responsible for initializing and retrieving instances of language models from various providers such as OpenAI, Aleph Alpha, Anthropic, and Cohere. It is designed to work within a project that interacts with language models and requires secure storage and retrieval of API keys for these services.

## Attributes

- `openai_api_key`: Stores the API key for OpenAI services, retrieved from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `aleph_alpha_api_key`: Stores the API key for Aleph Alpha services, retrieved from the environment variable `ALEPH_ALPHA_API_KEY`.
- `anthropic_api_key`: Stores the API key for Anthropic services, retrieved from the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- `cohere_api_key`: Stores the API key for Cohere services, retrieved from the environment variable `COHERE_API_KEY`.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, system)`

The constructor method initializes the `BaseModel` instance by calling the superclass constructor with the `system` parameter and setting up the API keys for the various language model providers by reading from the respective environment variables.

#### Parameters

- `system`: The system configuration or context required by the superclass `LLMModel`.

### `get_model(self, database_connection, model_family="openai", model_name="davinci-003", api_base=None, **kwargs) -> Any`

The `get_model` method is responsible for retrieving an instance of a language model based on the provided parameters. It optionally decrypts an API key stored in a `DatabaseConnection` object and initializes the appropriate language model client.

#### Parameters

- `database_connection` (`DatabaseConnection`): An object containing database connection information, including an optionally encrypted API key for a language model service.
- `model_family` (`str`, optional): The family of the language model to be used. Defaults to `"openai"`.
- `model_name` (`str`, optional): The name of the specific language model to be initialized. Defaults to `"davinci-003"`.
- `api_base` (`str | None`, optional): The base URL for the API, if different from the default. Defaults to `None`.
- `**kwargs` (`Any`): Additional keyword arguments that may be required for initializing the language model.

#### Returns

- Returns an instance of the language model client.

#### Raises

- `ValueError`: If no valid API key is found in either the `database_connection` object or the environment variables.

#### Behavior

1. If an API key is provided in the `database_connection` object, it is decrypted using `FernetEncrypt` and used to set the appropriate API key attribute based on the `model_family`.
2. Depending on the `model_family` specified and the availability of the corresponding API key, an instance of the language model client is created using the `model_name` and any additional keyword arguments.
3. If no API key is available for the specified `model_family`, a `ValueError` is raised.

#### Usage

The `get_model` method is typically used within the project to instantiate a language model client that can be used to perform various natural language processing tasks. The method abstracts away the details of API key management and client initialization, providing a simple interface for the rest of the project to access language model services.

## Dependencies

- `os`: Used to access environment variables.
- `typing`: Provides type annotations.
- `langchain.llms`: Contains classes for different language model providers.
- `overrides`: Used to indicate that the `get_model` method overrides a superclass method.
- `dataherald.model`: Contains the `LLMModel` superclass.
- `dataherald.sql_database.models.types`: Contains the `DatabaseConnection` type.
- `dataherald.utils.encrypt`: Contains the `FernetEncrypt` class for encryption and decryption.

## Notes

- The `api_base` parameter is marked with `# noqa: ARG002` to ignore a specific linting rule, indicating that the parameter is intentionally optional and may not be used.
- The `**kwargs` parameter allows for flexibility in passing additional arguments required by specific language model clients.
- The `get_model` method uses the `override` decorator to ensure that it correctly overrides a method in the superclass.
