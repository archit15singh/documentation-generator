# `dataherald` Package

The `dataherald` package is designed to provide an interface for interacting with a data processing and notification system. It is structured as a Python module that can be imported into other Python scripts or applications to leverage its functionality.

## Modules and Sub-packages

The package consists of the following main components:

- `api`: A submodule that contains the `API` class, which provides the methods for interacting with the data processing system.
- `config`: A submodule that contains the `Settings` and `System` classes, which are used for configuring the system's behavior and initializing system components respectively.

## Global Variables

- `__settings`: An instance of the `Settings` class, which holds the default configuration for the system. This instance is used as the default settings when initializing the `API` client.
- `__version__`: A string that represents the current version of the `dataherald` package. This can be used for logging, debugging, or compatibility checks.

## Functions

### `client(settings: Settings = __settings) -> API`

The `client` function is the primary entry point for users of the `dataherald` package to obtain an instance of the `API` class, which is ready to use for interacting with the system.

#### Parameters:

- `settings`: An optional parameter of type `Settings`. If provided, it will be used to configure the system. If not provided, the default `__settings` instance will be used.

#### Returns:

- An instance of the `API` class, which has been initialized and started, ready for use.

#### Behavior:

1. The function accepts an optional `settings` parameter, which allows the caller to specify custom settings for the system. If no custom settings are provided, the default `__settings` instance is used.
2. A `System` instance is created by passing the `settings` to its constructor. The `System` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle and dependencies of system components.
3. The `instance` method of the `System` class is called with the `API` class as its argument. This method is responsible for creating an instance of the `API` class, which serves as the interface for the data processing system.
4. The `start` method of the `System` class is called to initialize and start any necessary components or services required by the `API` instance.
5. The fully initialized `API` instance is returned to the caller.

## Usage

To use the `dataherald` package, a developer would typically import the `client` function from the package and call it to obtain an `API` instance. They can then use this instance to interact with the data processing system.

Example:

```python
from dataherald import client

# Initialize the API client with default settings
api = client()

# Use the API instance to perform operations
result = api.some_method()
```

If custom settings are needed, the developer can create an instance of the `Settings` class, modify it as needed, and pass it to the `client` function.

Example:

```python
from dataherald import client
from dataherald.config import Settings

# Create custom settings
custom_settings = Settings()
custom_settings.some_option = 'custom_value'

# Initialize the API client with custom settings
api = client(settings=custom_settings)

# Use the API instance to perform operations
result = api.some_method()
```

The `dataherald` package abstracts the complexity of system initialization and configuration, providing a simple interface for developers to interact with the data processing system.
