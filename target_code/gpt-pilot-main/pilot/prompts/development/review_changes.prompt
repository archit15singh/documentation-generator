A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `{{ file_name }}`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
{{ old_content }}
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

{% for hunk in hunks %}## Hunk {{ loop.index }}
```diff
{{ hunk }}
```
{% endfor %}

As you can see, there {% if hunks|length == 1 %}is only one hunk in this diff, and it{% else %}are {{hunks|length}} hunks in this diff, and each{% endif %} starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be applied or should be ignored (for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for). Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `{{ file_name }}`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, you should not ignore those changes. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important.

Here is an example output if 3 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied and one of them should be ignored, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "Explanation why the fourth hunk should be included in the change",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!
